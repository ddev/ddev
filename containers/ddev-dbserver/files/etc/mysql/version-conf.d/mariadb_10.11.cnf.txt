# mariadb 10.8 and higher don't seem to be able to work with innodb_use_native_aio
# without a privileged container, which seems like too much risk

# Message on start is like this:
#  [Warning] mysqld: io_uring_queue_init() failed with errno 1
#  [Warning] InnoDB: liburing disabled: falling back to innodb_use_native_aio=OFF
# These docker-compose overrides were able to make innodb-use-native-aio work
# For innodb_use_native_aio=ON mariadb versions need this, see
