# Docker Container for phpMyAdmin

This repo provides a Dockerfile to build the [Official phpMyAdmin Docker image](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/docker). It introduces a `HEALTHCHECK` and the [build-tools](https://github.com/drud/build-tools), but currently no other changes from upstream. See the upstream project for further documentation & details on the phpMyAdmin container.
