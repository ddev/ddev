# ddev-traefik-router docker image

## Overview

ddev-traefik-router is a simple wrapper on the upstream [traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik) image.

This container is used to allow all [DDEV](https://github.com/ddev/ddev) sites to exist side by side on shared ports (typically 80, 443, etc.). It serves as a reverse proxy to those sites, and forwards traffic to the appropriate site depending on the hostname.

This container image is part of DDEV, and not typically used stand-alone.

### Features

## What is DDEV?

[DDEV](https://github.com/ddev/ddev) is an open source tool for launching local web development environments in minutes. It supports PHP, Node.js, and Python (experimental).

These environments can be extended, version controlled, and shared, so you can take advantage of a Docker workflow without Docker experience or bespoke configuration. Projects can be changed, powered down, or removed as easily as theyâ€™re started.
