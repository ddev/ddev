# Example DDEV-Live provider configuration.

# #If you have a DDEV-Live account with an active site, you can follow this quick start guide to spin up a DDEV-Live site locally. If you don't already have a DDEV-Live account, a free short-term trial is [available on signup](https://dash.ddev.com/).
# #
# #1. Get your DDEV-Live API token on the [DDEV Dashboar](https://dash.ddev.com/settings/integration).
# #2. Using either `ddev-live` on the host or in the web container, authenticate and create a database backup, `ddev-live create backup database <sitename>`. You can do this again any time you need a fresh version from the upstream site.
# #3. Create a files backup using `ddev-live create backup files <sitename>`. This doesn't need to be done again until you have upstream files that have changed that you need.
# #4. Check out the git repository of the site.
# #5. Use `ddev config` to configure it.
# #6. Copy .ddev/providers/ddev-live.yaml.example to .ddev/providers/ddev-live.yaml
# #7. Edit ddev-live.yaml to set the environment_variables to ones that match your site.
# #8. Add add an entry to web_environment in ~/.ddev/global_config.yaml with the token:
# #
# #   ```yaml
# #   web_environment:
# #   - DDEV_LIVE_API_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx
# #   ```
# #9. `ddev restart`
# #10. Use `ddev pull ddev-live` to pull the project database and files.
# #11. Optionally use `ddev push ddev-live` to push local files and databases to DDEV-Live. Note that `ddev push` is a command that can potentially damage your production site, so this is not recommended.
