#ddev-generated
# Example Acquia provider configuration.

# To use this configuration,

# 1. Get your Acquia API token from your Account Settings->API Tokens.
# 2. Make sure your ssh key is authorized on your Acquia account at Account Settings->SSH Keys
# 3. `ddev auth ssh` (this typically needs only be done once per ddev session, not every pull.)
# 4. Add / update the web_environment section in ~/.ddev/global_config.yaml with the API keys:
#    ```yaml
#    web_environment:
#    - ACQUIA_API_KEY=xxxxxxxx
#    - ACQUIA_API_SECRET=xxxxx
#    ```
# 5. Copy .ddev/providers/acquia.yaml.example to .ddev/providers/acquia.yaml.
# 6. Update the project_id corresponding to the environment you want to work with.
#   - If have acli install, you can use the following command: `acli remote:aliases:list`
#   - Or, on the Acquia Cloud Platform navigate to the environments page, click on the header and look for the "SSH URL" line. Eg. `project1.dev@cool-projects.acquia-sites.com` would have a project ID of `project1.dev`
# 7. Your project must include drush; `ddev composer require drush/drush` if it isn't there already.
# 8. `ddev restart`
# 9. Use `ddev pull acquia` to pull the project database and files.
# 10. Optionally use `ddev push acquia` to push local files and database to Aquia. Note that `ddev push` is a command that can potentially damage your production site, so this is not recommended.

# Debugging: Use `ddev exec acli command` and `ddev exec acli auth:info`
# Make sure you remembered to `ddev auth ssh`
