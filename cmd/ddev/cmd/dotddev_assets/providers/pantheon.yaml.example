#ddev-generated
# Example Pantheon.io provider configuration.
# This example is Drupal/drush oriented,
# but can be adapted for other CMSs supported by Pantheon

# To use this configuration:
# 1. Check out the project code from your pantheon project
# 2. Verify that drush is installed in your project, `ddev composer require drush/drush`
# 3. Make sure your public ssh key is configured in Pantheon (Account->SSH Keys)
# 4. Create a Pantheon.io machine token (Account->Machine Tokens).
# 5. Add add an entry to web_environment in ~/.ddev/global_config.yaml with the token:
# web_environment:
# - TERMINUS_MACHINE_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx
# 6. Copy pantheon.yaml.example to pantheon.yaml.
# 7. `ddev auth ssh`
# 8. Update project_id and environment_name. project_id can usually be the project name.
# 9. `ddev restart`
# 10. Use `ddev pull pantheon` to pull the project database and files.
# 11. You can optionally use `ddev push pantheon` but it's a very dangerous thing to do and not recommended as part of your workflow

# Debugging: Use `ddev exec terminus auth:whoami` to see what terminus knows about
# `ddev exec terminus site:list` will show available sites
