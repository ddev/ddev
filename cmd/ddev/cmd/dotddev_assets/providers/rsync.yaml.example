#ddev-generated
# Example rsync provider configuration.

# This will pull a database and files from a network location, for example,
# server or other jumphost. It operates inside the web container and uses
# ssh, so you need to `ddev auth ssh` first.

# To use this configuration,
#
# 1. You need a database dump and/or user-generated files tarball that you
#    have access to somewhere on the internet
# 2. Copy rsync.yaml.example to rync.yaml (or name it as you see fit)
# 3. `ddev auth ssh` (only needs to be done once per ddev session or reboot)
# 4. Use `ddev pull rsync` to pull the project database and files.

# Note that while this is done in the web container (because rsync will always be there)
# it could also be done on the host.
