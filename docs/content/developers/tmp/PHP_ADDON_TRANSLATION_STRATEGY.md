# PHP Add-on Translation Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for translating existing bash-based DDEV add-ons to PHP to validate and demonstrate the capabilities of the new PHP add-on system.

## Objective

Validate the PHP add-on system's real-world effectiveness by translating popular, complex add-ons from bash to PHP. The PHP add-on system now provides comprehensive environment variable access, processed configuration data, and consistent execution context, making translation significantly more practical than originally envisioned.

   - PHP syntax validation prevents execution of invalid code
   - Removal actions work reliably without running project
   - Single-container optimization improves performance

3. **Create translation plan**
   - Leverage environment variables: `$_ENV['DDEV_DOCROOT']`, `$_ENV['DDEV_PROJECT_TYPE']`
   - Use processed configuration: `yaml_parse_file('.ddev-config/project_config.yaml')`
   - Employ relative paths from working directory: `/var/www/html/.ddev`
   - Design error handling with PHP exceptions and exit codes

### Step 2: Implementation ‚úÖ **STREAMLINED PROCESS**

2. **Leverage PHP add-on advantages** ‚úÖ **FULLY AVAILABLE**
   - Environment variable access: `$_ENV['DDEV_PROJECT_TYPE']`, `$_ENV['DDEV_DOCROOT']`
   - Processed configuration: `.ddev-config/project_config.yaml`, `.ddev-config/global_config.yaml`  
   - Consistent execution context: `/var/www/html/.ddev` working directory
   - Robust YAML processing with `yaml_parse_file()` and `yaml_emit()`
   - System-level error handling equivalent to bash `set -eu -o pipefail`
   - Automatic PHP syntax validation before execution
   - Removal actions that work without running project
   - Single-container execution for performance optimization

3. **Comprehensive testing** ‚úÖ **ENHANCED VALIDATION**
   - Test all original scenarios with identical behavior
   - Validate environment variable consistency with bash actions
