You can find a set of DDEV logos [here](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/tree/master/docs/content/developers/logos).

If possible, use the [SVG version](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/tree/master/docs/content/developers/logos/SVG) of the logo, as a vector graphic is independent of the resolution and gives the best results regardless of the pixel density of the display.

If the SVG format is not supported, you can use the exported PNG versions of the logo. Use [@2x](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/tree/master/docs/content/developers/logos/2x), [@3x](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/tree/master/docs/content/developers/logos/3x), and [@4x](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/tree/master/docs/content/developers/logos/4x) for high
pixel density displays. Many applications support [@2x](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/tree/master/docs/content/developers/logos/2x) annotations in the image path and automatically choose the correct image for the display in use.

Currently there is no prepared version for dark backgrounds of the word/figurative mark.
