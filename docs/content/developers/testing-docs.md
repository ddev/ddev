# Working on the Docs

This section is designed for people who want to contribute to the DDEV documentation.

On any page in the docs

## Fork / Clone the DDEV Repository

To start making changes you’ll need a local copy of the DDEV documentation, so [fork the DDEV repository](https://github.com/drud/ddev/fork) which includes the documentation.

After forking the repository, you can clone it to your local machine.

## Make Changes

Now that you’ve got a local copy, you can make your changes.

| Action               | Path                                                                    |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Documentation        | `./docs/content/users/*` <br> `./docs/content/developers/*`             |
| MkDocs configuration | `./mkdocs.yml`                                                          |
| Front end            | `./docs/content/assets/extra.css` <br> `./docs/content/assets/extra.js` |

## Preview Changes

Preview your changes locally by running `make mkdocs-serve`.

This will launch a web server on port 8000 and automatically refresh pages as they’re edited.

!!!tip "No need to install MkDocs locally!"
    It’s easiest to install [install MkDocs locally](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/), but you don’t have to. The `make mkdocs-serve` command will look for and use a local binary, otherwise using `make` to build and serve the documenation. If you don’t have `make` installed on your system, you can directly run the command it would have instead:

    ```
    docker run -it -p 8000:8000 -v "${PWD}:/docs" -e "ADD_MODULES=mkdocs-material mkdocs-redirects mkdocs-minify-plugin mdx_truly_sane_lists mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin" -e "LIVE_RELOAD_SUPPORT=true" -e "FAST_MODE=true" -e "DOCS_DIRECTORY=./docs" polinux/mkdocs;
    ```

## Check Markdown for Errors

Run `make markdownlint` before you publish changes to quickly check your files for errors or inconsistencies.

!!!warning "`markdownlint-cli` required!"
    The `make markdownlint` command requires you to have `markdownlint-cli` installed, which you can do by executing `npm install -g markdownlint-cli`

## Publish Changes

If all looks good, it’s time to commit your changes and make a pull request back into the official DDEV repository.

When you make a pull request, several tasks and test actions will be run. One of those is a task named `docs/readthedocs.org:ddev`, which builds a version of the docs containing all the changes from your pull request. You can use that to confirm the final result is exactly what you’d expect.
