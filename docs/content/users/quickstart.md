# CMS Quickstarts

While the generic `php` project type is [ready to go](./project.md) with any CMS or framework, DDEV offers project types for more easily working with popular platforms and content management systems:

=== "Craft CMS"

    ## Craft CMS

    Start a new [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) project or retrofit an existing one.

    !!!tip "Compatibility with Craft CMS 3"
        The `craftcms` project type is best with Craft CMS 4+, which is more opinionated about some settings. If you are using Craft CMS 3, you may want to use the `php` project type and [manage settings yourself](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/4650).

    Environment variables will be automatically added to your `.env` file to simplify the first boot of a project. For _new_ installations, this means the default URL and database connection settings displayed during installation can be used without modification. If _existing_ projects expect environment variables to be named in a particular way, you are welcome to rename them.

    === "New projects"

        New Craft CMS projects can be created from the official [starter project](https://github.com/craftcms/craft) using DDEV’s [`composer create` command](../users/usage/commands.md#composer):

        ```bash
        # Create a project directory and move into it:
        mkdir my-craft-project
        cd my-craft-project

        # Set up the DDEV environment:
        ddev config --project-type=craftcms --docroot=web --create-docroot

        # Boot the project and install the starter project:
        ddev start
        ddev composer create -y --no-scripts craftcms/craft

        # Run the Craft installer:
        ddev craft install
        ddev launch
        ```

        Third-party starter projects can by used the same way—just substitute the package name when running `ddev composer create`.

    === "Existing projects"

        You can start using DDEV with an existing project, too—just make sure you have a database backup handy!

        ```bash
        # Clone an existing repository (or navigate to a local project directory):
        git clone https://github.com/example/example-site my-craft-project
        cd my-craft-project

        # Set up the DDEV environment:
        ddev config --project-type=craftcms

        # Boot the project and install Composer packages:
        ddev start
        ddev composer install

        # Import a database backup and open the site in your browser:
        ddev import-db --file=/path/to/db.sql.gz
        ddev launch
        ```

    Craft CMS projects use PHP 8.1 and MySQL 8.0, by default. You can override these settings during setup with [`config` command flags](./usage/commands.md#config) or after setup via the [configuration files](./configuration/config.md).

    !!!tip "Upgrading or using a generic project type?"
        If you previously set up DDEV in a Craft project using the generic `php` project type, update the `type:` setting in `.ddev/config.yaml` to `craftcms`, then run [`ddev restart`](../users/usage/commands.md#restart) apply the changes.

    ### Running Craft in a Sub-directory

    In order for `ddev craft` to work when Craft is installed in a sub-directory, you will need to change the location of the `craft` executable by providing the `CRAFT_CMD_ROOT` environment variable to the web container. For example, if the installation lives in `my-craft-project/app`, you would run `ddev config --web-environment-add=CRAFT_CMD_ROOT=./app`. `CRAFT_CMD_ROOT` defaults to `./`, the project root directory. Run `ddev restart` to apply the change.

    More information about customizing the environment and persisting configuration can be found in [Providing Custom Environment Variables to a Container](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/customization-extendibility/#providing-custom-environment-variables-to-a-container).

    !!!tip "Installing Craft"
        Read more about installing Craft in the [official documentation](https://craftcms.com/docs).

=== "Django"

    ## Django 4 (Experimental)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/example/my-django-site
    cd my-django-site
    ddev config # Follow the prompts
    # If your settings file is not `settings.py` you must add a DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
    ddev config --web-environment-add=DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=<myapp.settings.local>
    ddev start
    # If your app requires setup, do it here:
    # ddev python manage.py migrate
    ddev launch
    ```

    * DDEV will install all everything in your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` into a `venv`. This takes a little while on first startup.
    * DDEV appends a stanza to your settings file which includes the DDEV settings only if running in DDEV context.
    * You can watch the `pip install` in real time on that first slow startup with `ddev logs -f` in another window.
    * If your `requirements.txt` includes `psycopg2` it requires build tools, so either set `ddev config --web-extra-packages=build-essential` or change your requirement to `psycopg2-binary`.

=== "Drupal"

    ## Drupal

    === "Drupal 10"

        ### Drupal 10 via Composer

        ```bash
        mkdir my-drupal10-site
        cd my-drupal10-site
        ddev config --project-type=drupal10 --docroot=web --create-docroot
        ddev start
        ddev composer create drupal/recommended-project
        ddev composer require drush/drush
        ddev drush site:install --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin -y
        ddev drush uli
        ddev launch
        ```

    === "Drupal 9"

        ### Drupal 9 via Composer

        ```bash
        mkdir my-drupal9-site
        cd my-drupal9-site
        ddev config --project-type=drupal9 --docroot=web --create-docroot
        ddev start
        ddev composer create "drupal/recommended-project:^9"
        ddev composer require drush/drush
        ddev drush site:install --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin -y
        ddev drush uli
        ddev launch
        ```

    === "Drupal 6/7"

        ### Drupal 6/7

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/example/my-drupal-site
        cd my-drupal-site
        ddev config # Follow the prompts to select type and docroot
        ddev start
        ddev launch /install.php
        ```

        Drupal 7 doesn’t know how to redirect from the front page to `/install.php` if the database is not set up but the settings files *are* set up, so launching with `/install.php` gets you started with an installation. You can also `drush site-install`, then `ddev exec drush site-install --yes`.

        See [Importing a Database](#importing-a-database).

    === "Git Clone"

        ### Git Clone

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/example/my-drupal-site
        cd my-drupal-site
        ddev config # Follow the prompts to set Drupal version and docroot
        ddev composer install # If a composer build
        ddev launch
        ```

    === "Backdrop"

        ### Backdrop

        To get started with [Backdrop](https://backdropcms.org), clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/example/example-site
        cd example-site
        ddev config
        ddev start
        ddev launch
        ```

=== "ExpressionEngine"

    ## ExpressionEngine

    === "ExpressionEngine ZIP File Download"

        Download the ExpressionEngine code from [expressionengine.com](https://expressionengine.com/), then follow these steps based on the [official installation instructions](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/installation/installation.html):

        ```bash
        mkdir my-ee && cd my-ee
        unzip /path/to/ee-zipfile.zip
        ddev config # Accept the defaults
        ddev start
        ddev launch /admin.php # Open installation wizard in browser
        ```

        When the installation wizard prompts for database settings, enter `db` for the _DB Server Address_, _DB Name_, _DB Username_, and _DB Password_.

        Visit your site.

    === "ExpressionEngine Git Checkout"

        Follow these steps based on the [ExpressionEngine Git Repository README.md](https://github.com/ExpressionEngine/ExpressionEngine#how-to-install):

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ExpressionEngine/ExpressionEngine # for example
        cd ExpressionEngine
        ddev config # Accept the defaults
        ddev start
        ddev composer install
        touch system/user/config/config.php
        echo "EE_INSTALL_MODE=TRUE" >.env.php
        ddev start
        ddev launch /admin.php  # Open installation wizard in browser
        ```

        When the installation wizard prompts for database settings, enter `db` for the _DB Server Address_, _DB Name_, _DB Username_, and _DB Password_.

=== "Laravel"

    ## Laravel

    === "Laravel"

        Use a new or existing Composer project, or clone a Git repository.

        The Laravel project type can be used for [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/) just as it can for Laravel. DDEV automatically updates or creates the `.env` file with the database information.

        === "Composer"
            ```bash
            mkdir my-laravel-app
            cd my-laravel-app
            ddev config --project-type=laravel --docroot=public --create-docroot --php-version=8.1
            ddev composer create --prefer-dist --no-install --no-scripts laravel/laravel -y
            ddev composer install
            ddev exec "php artisan key:generate"
            ddev launch
            ```
        === "Git Clone"
            ```bash
            git clone <your-laravel-repo>
            cd <your-laravel-project>
            ddev config --project-type=laravel --docroot=public --create-docroot --php-version=8.1
            ddev start
            ddev composer install
            ddev exec "php artisan key:generate"
            ddev launch
            ```

    === "Statamic"

        Use a new or existing Composer project, or clone a Git repository.

        The Laravel project type can be used for [Statamic](https://statamic.com/) just as it can for Laravel. DDEV automatically updates or creates the `.env` file with the database information.

        === "Composer"
            ```bash
            mkdir my-statamic-app
            cd my-statamic-app
            ddev config --project-type=laravel --docroot=public --create-docroot
            ddev composer create --prefer-dist --no-install --no-scripts statamic/statamic
            ddev composer install
            ddev exec "php artisan key:generate"
            ddev launch
            ```
        === "Git Clone"
            ```bash
            git clone <your-statamic-repo>
            cd <your-statamic-project>
            ddev config --project-type=laravel --docroot=public --create-docroot
            ddev start
            ddev composer install
            ddev exec "php artisan key:generate"
            ddev launch
            ```

=== "Magento"

    ## Magento 2

    Normal details of a Composer build for Magento 2 are on the [Magento 2 site](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/composer.html). You must have a public and private key to install from Magento’s repository. When prompted for “username” and “password” in `composer create`, it’s asking for your public and private keys.

    ```bash
    mkdir ddev-magento2 && cd ddev-magento2
    ddev config --project-type=magento2 --php-version=8.1 --docroot=pub --create-docroot --disable-settings-management
    ddev get ddev/ddev-elasticsearch
    ddev start
    ddev composer create --repository=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-community-edition -y
    rm -f app/etc/env.php

    # Change the base-url below to your project's URL
    ddev magento setup:install --base-url='https://ddev-magento2.ddev.site/' --cleanup-database --db-host=db --db-name=db --db-user=db --db-password=db --elasticsearch-host=elasticsearch --search-engine=elasticsearch7 --elasticsearch-port=9200 --admin-firstname=Magento --admin-lastname=User --admin-email=user@example.com --admin-user=admin --admin-password=admin123 --language=en_US

    ddev magento deploy:mode:set developer
    ddev magento module:disable Magento_TwoFactorAuth Magento_AdminAdobeImsTwoFactorAuth
    ddev config --disable-settings-management=false
    ```

    Change the admin name and related information is needed.

    You may want to add the [Magento 2 Sample Data](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/install/sample-data-after-composer.html) with `ddev magento sampledata:deploy && ddev magento setup:upgrade`.

    Magento 2 is a huge codebase, and we recommend [using Mutagen for performance](install/performance.md#using-mutagen) on macOS and traditional Windows.

    ## OpenMage/Magento 1

    1. Download OpenMage from [release page](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/releases).
    2. Make a directory for it, for example `mkdir ~/workspace/OpenMage` and change to the new directory `cd ~/workspace/OpenMage`.
    3. Run [`ddev config`](../users/usage/commands.md#config) and accept the defaults.
    4. Install sample data. (See below.)
    5. Run [`ddev start`](../users/usage/commands.md#start).
    6. Follow the URL to the base site.

    You may want the [Magento 1 Sample Data](https://github.com/Vinai/compressed-magento-sample-data) for experimentation:

    * Download Magento [1.9.2.4 Sample Data](https://github.com/Vinai/compressed-magento-sample-data/raw/master/compressed-magento-sample-data-1.9.2.4.tgz).
    * Extract the download:
        `tar -zxf ~/Downloads/compressed-magento-sample-data-1.9.2.4.tgz --strip-components=1`
    * Import the example database `magento_sample_data_for_1.9.2.4.sql` with `ddev import-db --file=magento_sample_data_for_1.9.2.4.sql` to database **before** running OpenMage install.

    OpenMage is a huge codebase, and we recommend [using Mutagen for performance](install/performance.md#using-mutagen) on macOS and traditional Windows.

=== "Moodle"

    ## Moodle

    ```bash
    ddev config --composer-root=public --create-docroot --docroot=public --webserver-type=apache-fpm
    ddev start
    ddev composer create moodle/moodle -y
    ddev exec 'php public/admin/cli/install.php --non-interactive --agree-license --wwwroot=$DDEV_PRIMARY_URL --dbtype=mariadb --dbhost=db --dbname=db --dbuser=db --dbpass=db --fullname="DDEV Moodle Demo" --shortname=Demo --adminpass=password'
    ddev launch /login
    ```

    In the web browser, log into your account using `admin` and `password`.

    Visit the [Moodle Admin Quick Guide](https://docs.moodle.org/400/en/Admin_quick_guide) for more information.

    !!!tip
        Moodle relies on a periodic cron job—don’t forget to set that up! See [ddev/ddev-cron](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-cron).

=== "Python"

    ## Python/Flask (Experimental)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/example/my-python-site
    cd my-python-site
    ddev config # Follow the prompts
    # Tell gunicorn where your app is (WSGI_APP)
    ddev config --web-environment-add=WSGI_APP=<my-app:app>
    ddev start
    # If you need to do setup before the site can go live, do it:
    # ddev exec flask forge
    ddev launch
    ```

    * DDEV will install all everything in your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` into a `venv`. This takes a little while on first startup.
    * If your app requires settings, you can add them as environment variables, or otherwise configure your app to use the database, etc. (Database settings are host: `db`, database: `db`, user: `db`, password `db` no matter whether you're using PostgreSQL, MariaDB, or MySQL.)
    * You can watch `pip install` output in real time on that first slow startup with `ddev logs -f` in another window.
    * If your `requirements.txt` includes `psycopg2` it requires build tools, so either set `ddev config --web-extra-packages=build-essential` or change your requirement to `psycopg2-binary`. 

=== "Shopware"

    ## Shopware 6

    You can set up a Shopware 6 environment many ways, we recommend the following technique:

    ```bash
    git clone --branch=6.4 https://github.com/shopware/production my-shopware6
    cd my-shopware6
    ddev config --project-type=shopware6 --docroot=public
    ddev start
    ddev composer install --no-scripts
    # During system:setup you may have to enter the Database user (db), Database password (db)
    # Database host (db) and Database name (db).
    ddev exec bin/console system:setup --database-url=mysql://db:db@db:3306/db --app-url='${DDEV_PRIMARY_URL}'
    ddev exec bin/console system:install --create-database --basic-setup
    ddev launch /admin
    ```

    Log into the admin site (`/admin`) using the web browser. The default credentials are username `admin` and password `shopware`. You can use the web UI to install sample data or accomplish many other tasks.

    For more advanced tasks like adding elasticsearch, building and watching storefront and administration, see [susi.dev](https://susi.dev/ddev-shopware-6).

=== "TYPO3"

    ## TYPO3

    === "Composer"

        ### Composer

        ```bash
        mkdir my-typo3-site
        cd my-typo3-site
        ddev config --project-type=typo3 --docroot=public --create-docroot --php-version 8.1
        ddev start
        ddev composer create "typo3/cms-base-distribution"
        ddev exec touch public/FIRST_INSTALL
        ddev launch
        ```

    === "Git Clone"

        ### Git Clone

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/example/example-site
        cd example-site
        ddev config --project-type=typo3 --docroot=public --create-docroot --php-version 8.1
        ddev composer install
        ddev restart
        ddev exec touch public/FIRST_INSTALL
        ddev launch
        ```

=== "WordPress"

    ## WordPress

    There are several easy ways to use DDEV with WordPress:

    === "WP-CLI"

        ### WP-CLI

        DDEV has built-in support for [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/), the command-line interface for WordPress.

        ```bash
        mkdir my-wp-site
        cd my-wp-site/

        # Create a new DDEV project inside the newly-created folder
        # (Primary URL automatically set to `https://<folder>.ddev.site`)
        ddev config --project-type=wordpress
        ddev start

        # Download WordPress
        ddev wp core download

        # Launch in browser to finish installation
        ddev launch

        # OR use the following installation command
        # (we need to use single quotes to get the primary site URL from `.ddev/config.yaml` as variable)
        ddev wp core install --url='$DDEV_PRIMARY_URL' --title='New-WordPress' --admin_user=admin --admin_email=admin@example.com --prompt=admin_password

        # Launch WordPress admin dashboard in your browser
        ddev launch wp-admin/
        ```

    === "Bedrock"

        ### Bedrock

        [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) is a modern, Composer-based installation in WordPress:

        ```bash
        mkdir my-wp-bedrock-site
        cd my-wp-bedrock-site
        ddev config --project-type=wordpress --docroot=web --create-docroot
        ddev start
        ddev composer create roots/bedrock
        ```

        Update the `.env` file in the project root for Bedrock’s WordPress configuration convention:

        ```
        DB_NAME=db
        DB_USER=db
        DB_PASSWORD=db
        DB_HOST=db
        WP_HOME=${DDEV_PRIMARY_URL}
        WP_SITEURL=${WP_HOME}/wp
        WP_ENV=development
        ```

        You can then run [`ddev start`](../users/usage/commands.md#start) and [`ddev launch`](../users/usage/commands.md#launch).

        For more details, see [Bedrock installation](https://docs.roots.io/bedrock/master/installation/).

    === "Git Clone"

        ### Git Clone

        To get started using DDEV with an existing WordPress project, clone the project’s repository.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/example/my-site.git
        cd my-site
        ddev config
        ```

        You’ll see a message like:

        > An existing user-managed wp-config.php file has been detected!
        > Project DDEV settings have been written to:
        >
        > /Users/rfay/workspace/bedrock/web/wp-config-ddev.php

        Comment out any database connection settings in your `wp-config.php` file and add the following snippet to your `wp-config.php`, near the bottom of the file and before the include of `wp-settings.php`:

        ```php
        // Include for DDEV-managed settings in wp-config-ddev.php.
        $ddev_settings = dirname(__FILE__) . '/wp-config-ddev.php';
        if (is_readable($ddev_settings) && !defined('DB_USER')) {
        require_once($ddev_settings);
        }
        ```

        If you don't care about those settings, or config is managed elsewhere (like in a `.env`
        file), you can eliminate this message by adding a comment to `wp-config.php`:

        ```php
        // wp-config-ddev.php not needed
        ```

        Now run [`ddev start`](../users/usage/commands.md#start) and continue [importing a database](#importing-a-database) if you need to.

## Configuration Files

The [`ddev config`](../users/usage/commands.md#config) and `ddev start` commands attempt to create a CMS-specific settings file pre-populated with DDEV credentials. If you don't want DDEV to do this, set the [`disable_settings_management`](../users/configuration/config.md#disable_settings_management) config option to `true`.

For **Craft CMS** DDEV settings are added to the `.env` file.

For **Django 4** DDEV settings are placed in `.ddev/settings/settings.django4.py` and a stanza is added to your `settings.py` that is only invoked in DDEV context.

For **Drupal** and **Backdrop**, DDEV settings are written to a DDEV-managed file, `settings.ddev.php`. The `ddev config` command will ensure these settings are included in your `settings.php` through the following steps:

- Write DDEV settings to `settings.ddev.php`.
- If no `settings.php` file exists, create one that includes `settings.ddev.php`.
- If a `settings.php` file already exists, ensure that it includes `settings.ddev.php`, modifying `settings.php` to write the include if necessary.

For **Magento 1**, DDEV settings go into `app/etc/local.xml`.

In **Magento 2**, DDEV settings go into `app/etc/env.php`.

For **TYPO3**, DDEV settings are written to `AdditionalConfiguration.php`. If `AdditionalConfiguration.php` exists and is not managed by DDEV, it will not be modified.

For **WordPress**, DDEV settings are written to a DDEV-managed file, `wp-config-ddev.php`. The `ddev config` command will attempt to write settings through the following steps:

- Write DDEV settings to `wp-config-ddev.php`.
- If no `wp-config.php` exists, create one that include `wp-config-ddev.php`.
- If a DDEV-managed `wp-config.php` exists, create one that includes `wp-config.php`.
- If a user-managed `wp-config.php` exists, instruct the user on how to modify it to include DDEV settings.

You’ll know DDEV is managing a settings file when you see a comment containing `#ddev-generated` like the one below. Remove the comment and DDEV will not attempt to overwrite it. If you’re letting DDEV create its settings file, we recommended leaving this comment so DDEV can continue to manage it, and make any needed changes in another settings file.

```
/**
 #ddev-generated: Automatically generated Drupal settings.php file.
 ddev manages this file and may delete or overwrite the file unless this comment is removed.
 */
```

If you’re providing the `settings.php` or `wp-config.php` and DDEV is creating `settings.ddev.php` (or `wp-config-local.php`, `AdditionalConfig.php`, or similar), the main settings file must explicitly include the appropriate DDEV-generated settings file. Any changes you need should be included somewhere that loads after DDEV’s settings file, for example in Drupal’s `settings.php` _after_ `settings.ddev.php` is included. (See [Adding Configuration](#adding-configuration) below).

### Adding Configuration

**Drupal and Backdrop**: In `settings.php`, enable loading `settings.local.php` after `settings.ddev.php` is included—creating a new one if it doesn’t already exist—and make changes there. Wrap with `if (getenv('IS_DDEV_PROJECT') == 'true')` as needed.

**WordPress**: Load a `wp-config-local.php` after `wp-config-ddev.php`, and make changes there. Wrap with `if (getenv('IS_DDEV_PROJECT') == 'true')` as needed.

## Listing Project Information

Run [`ddev list`](../users/usage/commands.md#list) or `ddev list --active-only` current projects.

```

➜  ddev list
NAME          TYPE     LOCATION                   URL(s)                                STATUS
d8git         drupal8  ~/workspace/d8git          <https://d8git.ddev.local>              running
                                                <http://d8git.ddev.local>
hobobiker     drupal6  ~/workspace/hobobiker.com                                        stopped

```

```

➜  ddev list --active-only
NAME     TYPE     LOCATION             URL(s)                      STATUS
drupal8  drupal8  ~/workspace/drupal8  <http://drupal8.ddev.site>   running
                                        <https://drupal8.ddev.site>

```

You can also see more detailed information about a project by running [`ddev describe`](../users/usage/commands.md#describe) from its working directory. You can also run `ddev describe [project-name]` from any location to see the detailed information for a running project.

```

## Removing Projects

There are two ways to remove a project from DDEV’s listing.

The first, the [`ddev delete`](../users/usage/commands.md#delete) command, is destructive. It removes the project from DDEV’s list, deletes its database, and removes the hostname entry from the hosts file:

`ddev delete <projectname>`
or
`ddev delete --omit-snapshot <projectname>`

If you don’t want the project to show up in [`ddev list`](../users/usage/commands.md#list) anymore, use [`ddev stop`](../users/usage/commands.md#stop)—which is nondestructive—to unlist the project until the next time you run [`ddev start`](../users/usage/commands.md#start) or [`ddev config`](../users/usage/commands.md#config):

```bash
ddev stop --unlist <projectname>
```

## Importing Assets for An Existing Project

An important aspect of local web development is the ability to have a precise local recreation of the project you’re working on, including up-to-date database contents and static assets like uploaded images and files. DDEV provides two commands to help with importing assets to your local environment.

### Importing a Database

The [`ddev import-db`](../users/usage/commands.md#import-db) command imports the database for a project. Running this command will prompt you to specify the location of your database import. By default `ddev import-db` empties the default `db` database, then loads the provided dump file. Most people use it with command flags, like `ddev import-db --file=.tarballs/db.sql.gz`, but it can also prompt for the location of the dump if you only use `ddev import-db`:

```bash
ddev import-db
Provide the path to the database you wish to import.
Import path:
~/Downloads/db.sql
Importing database...
Successfully imported database for drupal8
```

#### Supported Database Import File Types

Database imports can be any of the following file types:

- Raw SQL Dump (`.sql`)
- Gzipped SQL Dump (`.sql.gz`)
- Xz’d SQL Dump (`.sql.xz`)
- (Gzipped) Tarball Archive (`.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`)
- Zip Archive (`.zip`)
- stdin

If a Tarball Archive or Zip Archive is provided for the import, you’ll be prompted to specify a path within the archive to use for the import asset. The specified path should provide a raw SQL dump (`.sql`). In the following example, the database we want to import is named `data.sql` and resides at the top level of the archive:

```bash
ddev import-db
Provide the path to the database you wish to import.
Import path:
~/Downloads/site-backup.tar.gz
You provided an archive. Do you want to extract from a specific path in your archive? You may leave this blank if you wish to use the full archive contents
Archive extraction path:
data.sql
Importing database...
A settings file already exists for your application, so ddev did not generate one.
Run 'ddev describe' to find the database credentials for this application.
Successfully imported database for drupal8
```

#### Non-Interactive Usage

If you want to use the [`import-db`](../users/usage/commands.md#import-db) command without answering prompts, you can use the `--source` flag to provide the path to the import asset. If you’re importing an archive and wish to specify the path within the archive to extract, you can use the `--extract-path` flag in conjunction with the `--source` flag. Examples:

```bash
ddev import-db --file=/tmp/mydb.sql.gz
gzip -dc /tmp/mydb.sql.gz | ddev import-db
ddev import-db <mydb.sql
```

#### Database Import Notes

- Importing from a dump file via stdin will not show progress because there’s no way the import can know how far along through the import it has progressed.
- Use `ddev import-db --target-db <some_database>` to import to a non-default database (other than the default `db` database). This will create the database if it doesn’t already exist.
- Use `ddev import-db --no-drop` to import without first emptying the database.
- If a database already exists and the import does not specify dropping tables, the contents of the imported dumpfile will be _added_ to the database. Most full database dumps do a table drop and create before loading, but if yours does not, you can drop all tables with `ddev stop --remove-data` before importing.
- If imports are stalling or failing, make sure you have plenty of unused space (see [#3360](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/3360)). DDEV has no problems importing large (2G+) databases, but importing requires lots of space. DDEV will show a warning on startup if unused space is getting low.
