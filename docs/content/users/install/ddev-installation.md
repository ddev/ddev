# DDEV Installation

Docker or an alternative is required before anything will work with DDEV. This is pretty easy on most environments; see the [docker installation](docker-installation.md) page to help sort out the details.

=== "macOS (Homebrew)"

    For macOS (both amd64 and arm64) users, we recommend installing and upgrading via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install drud/ddev/ddev`.
    
    As a one-time initialization, run `mkcert -install`.
    
    Later, to upgrade to a newer version of DDEV-Local, run `brew upgrade ddev`.
    
    !!!note "Edge channel is available"
        To install DDEV prereleases, subscribe to the "edge" channel with `brew install drud/ddev-edge/ddev` and to install the latest unreleased DDEV version, `brew unlink ddev && brew install drud/ddev/ddev --HEAD`.

=== "Install script"

    On Linux, macOS and Windows WSL2 you can use the install_ddev.sh script

    Use this line on your terminal to download, verify, and install (or upgrade) ddev using the [install_ddev.sh script](https://github.com/drud/ddev/blob/master/scripts/install_ddev.sh). Note that this works with both amd64 and arm64 architectures, including Surface Pro X with WSL2 and 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS. It also works with macOS Apple Silicon M1 machines.

    ```
    curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drud/ddev/master/scripts/install_ddev.sh && bash install_ddev.sh
    ```

    The installation script can also take a version argument in order to install a specific version or a prerelease version. For example,

    ```
    curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drud/ddev/master/scripts/install_ddev.sh && bash install_ddev.sh v1.19.2
    ```

    To upgrade DDEV to the latest stable version, just run the script again.

=== "Linux apt/yum"

    DDEV has Debian and RPM packages that work with both apt and yum repositories, and on most any variant that uses those, including Windows WSL2.

    * Debian/Ubuntu and derivative distros - Install the ddev apt repositories with:

    ```bash
    curl https://apt.fury.io/drud/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
    echo "deb https://apt.fury.io/drud/ * *" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddev.list
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ddev
    ```
  
    In the future you can update as usual, with `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`.

    * Yum/RPM (Fedora, RedHat, etc.):

    ```bash
    echo '[ddev]
    name=DDEV Repo
    baseurl=https://yum.fury.io/drud/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0' | sudo tee -a /etc/yum.repos.d/ddev.repo
      
    sudo dnf install --refresh ddev
    ```
  
    In the future you can update as usual, with `sudo dnf upgrade ddev`. (Signed repo support will be added in the near future.)

=== "Linux (Homebrew)"

    For Linux amd64 users, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) packages are available: `brew install drud/ddev/ddev`.
    
    As a one-time initialization, run `mkcert -install`.
    
    Later, to upgrade to a newer version of DDEV-Local, run `brew upgrade ddev`.
    
    !!!note "Edge channel is available"
        To install DDEV prereleases, subscribe to the "edge" channel with `brew install drud/ddev-edge/ddev` and to install the latest unreleased DDEV version, `brew unlink ddev && brew install drud/ddev/ddev --HEAD`.

=== "Windows WSL2"

    **This is the recommended installation method for all Windows users**.

    **All Windows 10/11 editions (including Windows 10 Home) support WSL2**. If you're already familiar with DDEV on Windows, you might have been using NFS for better filesystem performance. **You won't need NFS anymore once you switch to WSL2**, since it provides awesome filesystem performance out of the box.

    The WSL2 install process involves:

    * Installing Chocolatey package manager (optional).
    * One time initialization of mkcert.
    * Installing WSL2 and installing a distro like Ubuntu.
    * Installing or upgrading to the latest Docker Desktop for Windows with WSL2 enabled.
    * Installing DDEV inside your distro.

    We'll walk through these in more detail. You may prefer other techniques of installation or may not need some steps, but this is the full recipe:

    1. **Chocolatey:** We recommend using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) for installing required Windows apps like mkcert. In an administrative PowerShell, `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`
    2. In an administrative PowerShell: `choco install -y mkcert`
    3. In an administrative PowerShell, run `mkcert -install` and answer the prompt allowing the installation of the Certificate Authority.
    4. In an administrative PowerShell, run the command `setx CAROOT "$(mkcert -CAROOT)"; If ($Env:WSLENV -notlike "*CAROOT/up:*") { setx WSLENV "CAROOT/up:$Env:WSLENV" }`. This will set WSL2 to use the Certificate Authority installed on the Windows side.
    5. In administrative PowerShell, run the command `wsl --install`. This will install WSL2 and Ubuntu for you. Reboot when this is done.
    6. **Docker Desktop for Windows:** If you already have the latest Docker Desktop, configure it in the General Settings to use the WSL2-based engine. Otherwise install the latest Docker Desktop for Windows and select the WSL2-based engine (not legacy Hyper-V) when installing. Install via Chocolatey with `choco install docker-desktop` or it can be downloaded from [desktop.docker.com](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe).  Start Docker. It may prompt you to log out and log in again, or reboot.
    7. Go to Docker Desktop settings > Resources > WSL integration > enable integration for your distro (now `docker` commands will be available from within your WSL2 distro).
    8. Double-check in PowerShell: `wsl -l -v` should show three distros, and your Ubuntu should be the default. All three should be WSL version 2.
    9. Double-check in Ubuntu (or your distro): `echo $CAROOT` should show something like `/mnt/c/Users/<you>/AppData/Local/mkcert`
    10. Check that docker is working inside Ubuntu (or your distro): `docker ps`
    11. Optional: If you prefer to use the *traditional Windows* ddev instead of working inside WSL2, install it with `choco install -y ddev`. The Windows ddev works fine with the WSL2-based Docker engine. However, the WSL2 ddev setup is vastly preferable and at least 10 times as fast. Support for the traditional Windows approach will eventually be dropped.
    12. Open the WSL2 terminal, for example `Ubuntu` from the Windows start menu.
    13. Install `ddev` with `curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drud/ddev/master/scripts/install_ddev.sh && bash install_ddev.sh`
    14. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y certutil xdg-utils` to install the `xdg-utils` package that allows `ddev launch` to work.
    15. In WSL2 run `mkcert -install`.

    That's it! You have now installed DDEV on WSL2. If you're using WSL2 for DDEV (recommended), remember to run all `ddev` commands inside the WSL2 distro.
    Follow the instructions in the `Linux apt/yum` section.

    !!!warning "Projects go in /home, not on the Windows filesystem"
        Make sure you put your projects in the Linux filesystem (e.g. `/home/<your_username>`), **not** in the Windows filesystem (`/mnt/c`), because you'll get vastly superior performance on the Linux filesystem. You will be very unhappy if you put your project in `/mnt/c`.

    !!!note "Path to certificates"
        Note the prompt `Installing to the system store is not yet supported on this Linux`, which can be a simple result of not having `/usr/sbin` in the path so that `/usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates` can be found.)

=== "Traditional Windows"

    DDEV does work fine on the Windows side, although it's quite a bit slower than WSL2 by default, but good results have been reported by users who enabled mutagen, `ddev config global --mutagen-enabled`.

    * If you use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (recommended), then you can just `choco install ddev git` from an administrative shell. Upgrades are just `ddev poweroff && choco upgrade ddev`.
    * A windows installer is provided in each [ddev release](https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases) (`ddev_windows_installer.<version>.exe`). Run that and it will do the full installation for you.  Open a new git-bash or PowerShell or cmd window and start using ddev.
    * Most people interact with ddev on Windows using git-bash, part of the [Windows git suite](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Although ddev does work with cmd and PowerShell, it's more at home in bash. You can install it with chocolatey using `choco install -y git`.
    * For performance, many users enable mutagen, `ddev config global --mutagen-enabled` (global) or `ddev config --mutagen-enabled` just for one project.

    !!!note "Windows Firefox trusted CA"

        The `mkcert -install` step on Windows does not work for the Firefox browser.
        You need to add the created root certificate authority to the security
        configuration by your self:

        * Run `mkcert -install` (you can use the shortcut from the start menu for that)
        * Run `mkcert -CAROOT` to see the local folder used for the newly created root
          certificate authority
        * Open Firefox Preferences (about:preferences#privacy)
        * Enter `certificates` into the search box on the top
        * Click `View Certificates...`
        * Select the tab `Authorities`
        * Click to `Import...`
        * Go to the folder where your root certificate authority was stored
        * Select the file `rootCA.pem`
        * Click to `Open`

        You should now see your CA under `mkcert development CA`.

=== "Gitpod.io"

    DDEV is fully supported in Gitpod.io, and there are many ways to use it. You don't have to install *anything* to use it, not Docker, and not DDEV, it's all done for you.

    1. Just [open any repository](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) using gitpod and `brew install drud/ddev/ddev` and use ddev as you would normally use it.
        * To use `ddev launch` you'll need to `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y xdg-utils`.
        * You can just install your web app there, or import a database.
        * You may want to implement one of the `ddev pull` provider integrations to pull from a hosting provider or an upstream source.
    2. Use [ddev-gitpod-launcher](https://drud.github.io/ddev-gitpod-launcher/) form to launch a repository. See the actual instructions on the [repository](https://github.com/drud/ddev-gitpod-launcher). You just click the button and it opens a fully-set-up environment. If a companion artifacts repository with the suffix `-artifacts` is available, then the `db.sql.gz` and `files.tgz` from it will be automatically loaded.
    3. Save the following link, <a href="javascript: if %28 %2Fbitbucket%2F.test %28 window.location.host %29 %20 %29 %20%7B%20paths%3Dwindow.location.pathname.split %28 %22%2F%22 %29 %3B%20repo%3D%5Bwindow.location.origin%2C%20paths%5B1%5D%2C%20paths%5B2%5D%5D.join %28 %22%2F%22 %29 %20%7D%3B%20if %28 %2Fgithub.com%7Cgitlab.com%2F.test %28 window.location.host %29  %29 %20%7Brepo%20%3D%20window.location.href%7D%3B%20if%20 %28 repo %29 %20%7Bwindow.location.href%20%3D%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fgitpod.io%2F%23DDEV_REPO%3D%22%20%2B%20encodeURIComponent %28 repo %29 %20%2B%20%22%2CDDEV_ARTIFACTS%3D%22%20%2B%20encodeURIComponent %28 repo %29 %20%2B%20%22-artifacts%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdrud%2Fddev-gitpod-launcher%2F%22%7D%3B">Github -> ddev-gitpod</a>, to your bookmark bar; the "drag-and-drop" method is easiest. When you are on a git repository, click the new bookmark to open DDEV Gitpod. It does the same thing as the second option, but it works on non-chrome browsers and native browser keyboard shortcuts can be used.

    It can be complicated to get private databases and files into Gitpod, so in addition to the launchers, The [`git` provider example](https://github.com/drud/ddev/blob/master/pkg/ddevapp/dotddev_assets/providers/git.yaml.example) shows how you can pull database and files without complex setup or permissions. This was created explicitly for Gitpod integration, because in Gitpod you typically already have access to private git repositories, which are a fine place to put a starter database and files. Although [ddev-gitpod-launcher](https://drud.github.io/ddev-gitpod-launcher/) and the web extension provide the capability, you may want to integrate a git provider for each project (or, of course, one of the [other providers](https://github.com/drud/ddev/tree/master/pkg/ddevapp/dotddev_assets/providers)).

=== "Arch Linux"
    For Arch-based systems including `Arch Linux`, `EndeavourOS` and `Manjaro` we maintain the [ddev-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ddev-bin/) package in AUR.

    As a one-time initialization, run `mkcert -install`.

    !!!note "Edge channel is available"
        To install DDEV prereleases, use a [ddev-edge-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ddev-edge-bin/) package in AUR.

=== "Manual"

    You can also easily perform the installation or upgrade manually if preferred. DDEV is just a single executable, no special installation is actually required, so for all operating systems, the installation is just copying DDEV into place where it's in the system path.

    * `ddev poweroff` if upgrading
    * Download and extract the latest [ddev release](https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases) for your architecture.
    * Move ddev to /usr/local/bin: `mv ddev /usr/local/bin/` (may require sudo), or another directory in your `$PATH` as preferred.
    * Run `ddev` to test your installation. You should see DDEV's command usage output.
    * As a one-time initialization, run `mkcert -install`, which may require your sudo password. If you don't have mkcert installed, you can install it from <https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases>. Download the version for the correct architecture and `sudo mv <downloaded_file> /usr/local/bin/mkcert && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mkcert`.
