# Installation

Despite the fact that there are many ways to install and many platforms where DDEV can be installed, it's not hard.

This section explains how to

1. [install Docker or Colima](docker-installation.md) and then
2. [install DDEV](ddev-installation.md) on whatever platform you're on.

You'll want to read about [performance issues](performance.md) and enable Mutagen on macOS.

And it's easy to [enable shell auto-completion](shell-completion.md).
