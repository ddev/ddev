# Shell Completion & Autocomplete

Most people like to have shell completion on the command line. In other words, when you're typing a command, you can hit `<TAB>` and the shell will show you what the options are. For example, if you type `ddev <TAB>`, you'll see all the possible commands. `ddev debug <TAB>` will show you the options for the command. And `ddev list -<TAB>` will show you all the flags available for [`ddev list`](../usage/commands.md#list).

Shells like Bash and zsh need help to do this though, they have to know what the options are. DDEV provides the necessary hint scripts, and if you use Homebrew, they get installed automatically. But if you use oh-my-zsh, for example, you may have to manually install the hint script.

=== "macOS Bash + Homebrew"

    ## macOS Bash + Homebrew

    The easiest way to use Bash completion on macOS is install it with Homebrew. `brew install bash-completion`. When you install it though, it will warn you with something like this, which **may vary on your system**. Add the following line to your `~/.bash_profile` file:

    ```
    [[ -r "$(brew --prefix)/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] && . "$(brew --prefix)/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"
    ```

    !!!note "Bash profile"
        You must add the include to your `.bash_profile` or `.profile` or nothing will work. Use `source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.profile` to make it take effect immediately.

    Link completions by running `brew completions link`.

    When you install DDEV via Homebrew, each new release will automatically get a refreshed completions script.

=== "Bash/Zsh/Fish on Linux"

    ## Bash/Zsh/Fish on Linux

    On Debian and Yum based systems, if you installed DDEV using `apt install ddev`, the `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish` completions should be automatically installed at `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/ddev`, `/usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions/_ddev` and `/usr/share/fish/completions/ddev.fish` respectively, and the `bash` completions should be automatically installed at `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/bash`.

    Otherwise, you can download the completion files for manual installation as described [below](#tar-archive-of-completion-scripts-for-manual-deployment). Every Linux distro requires a different manual installation technique. On Debian/Ubuntu, you could deploy the `ddev_bash_completion.sh` script where it needs to be by running `sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/bash-completion/completions && sudo cp ddev_bash_completion.sh /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/ddev`.

=== "Oh-My-Zsh"

    ## Oh-My-Zsh

    If you installed zsh using Homebrew, DDEV’s completions should be automatically installed when you install DDEV using `brew install ddev/ddev/ddev`.

    Otherwise, you can extract the zsh completions file (`ddev_zsh_completion.sh`) from the tar archive of completion scripts included with each release. See [below](#tar-archive-of-completion-scripts-for-manual-deployment).
    
    Oh-My-Zsh may be set up very differently in different places, so you’ll need to put `ddev_bash_completion.sh` where it belongs. `echo $fpath` will show you the places that it’s most likely to belong. To install in `~/.oh-my-zsh/completions` (an obvious choice), you can run `mkdir -p ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions && cp ddev_zsh_completion.sh ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_ddev`, then `autoload -Uz compinit && compinit`.

=== "Fish"

    ## Fish

    `fish` shell completions are automatically installed at `/usr/local/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/ddev_fish_completion.sh` when you install DDEV via Homebrew.
    
    If you installed `fish` without Homebrew, you can extract the fish completions (`ddev_fish_completion.sh`) from the tar archive of completion scripts included with each release. See [below](#tar-archive-of-completion-scripts-for-manual-deployment).

=== "Git Bash"

    ## Git Bash

    Git Bash completions (`ddev_bash_completion.sh`) are provided in the tar archive of completion scripts included with each release. See [below](#tar-archive-of-completion-scripts-for-manual-deployment).
    
    Completions in Git Bash are sourced from at least the `~/bash_completion.d` directory. You can copy `ddev_bash_completion.sh` to that directory by running `mkdir -p ~/bash_completion.d && cp ddev_bash_completion.sh ~/bash_completion.d/ddev.bash`.

=== "PowerShell"

    ## PowerShell

    PowerShell completions (`ddev_powershell_completion.ps1`) are provided in the tar archive of completion scripts included with each release. See [below](#tar-archive-of-completion-scripts-for-manual-deployment).
    
    You can run the `ddev_powershell_completion.ps1` script manually or install it so it will be run whenever PS is opened using the technique described at [Run PowerShell Script When You Open PowerShell](https://superuser.com/questions/886951/run-powershell-script-when-you-open-powershell).

## tar Archive of Completion Scripts for Manual Deployment

Although most people will use techniques like Homebrew for installation, a tar archive of shell completion scripts for various shells is available in each release, called `ddev_shell_completion_scripts.<version>.tar.gz`. If you need to manually install, you can download the files and extract them with the following commands, replacing the VERSION number in the first line with your version:

```bash
VERSION=v1.22.6
curl -sSLf https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/download/${VERSION}/ddev_shell_completion_scripts.${VERSION}.tar.gz
tar -zxf ddev_shell_completion_scripts.${VERSION}.tar.gz
```

Alternatively, you could download the tar archive using a browser, from a URL such as the following, replacing the version numbers with your version: [https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/download/v1.22.6/ddev_shell_completion_scripts.v1.22.6.tar.gz](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/download/v1.22.6/ddev_shell_completion_scripts.v1.22.6.tar.gz).

After extracting the archive, copy the appropriate completion script where you need it, for example by running `sudo cp ddev_bash_completion.sh /etc/bash_completion.d/ddev`. Detailed instructions for various shells are given above.
