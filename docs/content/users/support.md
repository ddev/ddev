We love to hear from you and want you to be successful with DDEV!

* See the built-in help: `ddev help` and `ddev help <command>`. You'll find plenty of examples.
* [FAQ](basics/faq.md)
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/hCZFfAMc5k) interactive community support.
* [DDEV issue queue](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues) for bugs and feature requests
* [Twitter with tag #ddev](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ddev&src=typd&f=live) will get to us, but it's not as good for interactive support, but we'll answer anywhere.

## Additional docs sources on the Internet
