# Experimental Configurations

## `django4` and `python` Project Types

DDEV v1.22+ supports Python-based projects, including those built with Django 4 and Flask.

`ddev config --project-type=django4` will by default a project to use the `nginx-gunicorn` `webserver_type` and the `postgres` database type.

To get started with either one of these Python projects, checkout the [Django4 Quickstart](../quickstart/#django-4-experimental) or the [Flask Quickstart](../quickstart/#pythonflask-experimental).

Community feedback is essential for Django/Python support to improve, thank you for participating!
