# Experimental Docker Configurations

## Remote Docker Instances

You can use remote Docker instances, whether on the internet, inside your network, or running in a virtual machine.

* On the remote machine, the Docker port must be exposed if it’s not already. See [instructions](https://gist.github.com/styblope/dc55e0ad2a9848f2cc3307d4819d819f) for how to do this on a systemd-based remote server. **Be aware that this has serious security implications and must not be done without taking those into consideration.** In fact, `dockerd` will complain:

    > Binding to IP address without --tlsverify is insecure and gives root access on this machine to everyone who has access to your network.  host="tcp://0.0.0.0:2375".

* If you do not already have the Docker client installed (like you would from Docker Desktop), install *just* the client with `brew install docker`.
* Create a Docker context that points to the remote Docker instance. For example, if the remote hostname is `debian-11`, then `docker context create debian-11 --docker host=tcp://debian-11:2375 && docker use debian-11`. Alternately, you can use the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable, e.g. `export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://debian-11:2375`.
* Make sure you can access the remote machine using `docker ps`.
* Bind mounts cannot work on a remote Docker setup, so you must use `ddev config global --no-bind-mounts`. This will cause DDEV to push needed information to and from the remote Docker instance when needed. This also automatically turns on Mutagen caching.
* You may want to use a FQDN other than `*.ddev.site` because the DDEV site will *not* be at `127.0.0.1`. For example, `ddev config --fqdns=debian-11` and then use `https://debian-11` to access the site.
* If the Docker host is reachable on the internet, you can actually enable real HTTPS for it using Let’s Encrypt as described in [Casual Webhosting](../details/alternate-uses.md#casual-project-webhosting-on-the-internet-including-lets-encrypt). Just make sure port 2375 is not available on the internet.

## Rancher Desktop on macOS

[Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) is another quickly-maturing Docker Desktop alternative for macOS. You can install it for many target platforms from the [release page](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/releases).

Rancher Desktop integration currently has no automated testing for DDEV integration.

* By default, Rancher Desktop will provide a version of the Docker client if you don’t have one on your machine.
* Rancher changes over the “default” context in Docker, so you’ll want to turn off Docker Desktop if you’re using it.
* Rancher Desktop does not provide bind mounts, so use `ddev config global --no-bind-mounts` which also turns on Mutagen.
* Use a non-`ddev.site` name, `ddev config --additional-fqdns=rancher` for example, because the resolution of `*.ddev.site` seems to make it not work.
* Rancher Desktop does not seem to currently work with `mkcert` and `https`, so turn those off with `mkcert -uninstall && rm -r "$(mkcert -CAROOT)"`. This does no harm and can be undone with just `mkcert -install` again.
