# `.ddev/config.yaml` Options

Each project’s hidden `.ddev` directory contains a `.ddev/config.yaml` file with its primary configuration.

* You can override the `config.yaml` with extra files named `config.*.yaml`. For example, many teams use `config.local.yaml` for configuration that is specific to one environment, and not checked into the team’s default `config.yaml`.
* Most configuration options take effect on `ddev start`.
* Nearly all configuration options have equivalent `ddev config` flags, so you can use `ddev config` instead of editing `config.yaml`. See `ddev help config` to see all the flags.

It’s best if this matches the directory name. If this option is omitted, the project will take the name of the enclosing directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The `php` type doesn’t attempt CMS configuration or settings file management and can work with any project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

See [Database Server Types](../extend/database_types.md) for details and caveats.<br><br>DDEV v1.18 and earlier used `mariadb_version` and `mysql_version`, which are now automatically converted to the `database` format.                                                                                                            |

Can be changed if there’s a conflict on the host with that port.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Usually changed only if there’s a conflicting process using that port.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Most people use `ddev xdebug` and `ddev xdebug off` commands instead of configuring this, because Xdebug has a significant performance impact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Can be `2`, `1`, or empty (`""`) for latest major version at container build time.<br><br>Can also be a minor version like `2.2` for the latest release of that branch, an explicit version like `1.0.22`, or a keyword like `stable`, `preview` or `snapshot`. See Composer documentation.                                                                                                                                |
| nodejs_version                   | Node.js version for web container as “system” version                                     | Defaults to current LTS version. Can be `14`, `16`, or `18`. `nvm` is also available inside the container and via `ddev nvm`, and can be set to any valid version including much older ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| additional_hostnames             | Array of extra hostnames                                                                  | Example: `additional_hostnames: ["somename", "someothername", "*.thirdname"]` would provide HTTP and HTTPS URLs for `somename.ddev.site`, `someothername.ddev.site`, and `one.thirdname.ddev.site` + `two.thirdname.ddev.site`. The wildcard (`*`) setting only works if you’re using DNS to resolve hostnames (default) and connected to the internet.                                                                                     |

Take care with this because it can cause great confusion and adds extraneous items to your `/etc/hosts` file.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Some containers can be omitted globally in `~/.ddev/global_config.yaml` and the result is additive; all containers named in both places will be omitted.<br><br>Omitting the `db` container will cause database-dependent DDEV features to be unstable. |
| web_environment                  | Additional custom environment variables for the project’s web container                   | Example: `web_environment: ["SOMEENV=someval", "SOMEOTHERENV=someotherval"]`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| nfs_mount_enabled                | Whether to use NFS to mount the project into the container for performance                | Can be `true` or `false`, and requires host configuration before it can be used. See [nfs_mount_enabled documentation](../install/performance.md). Project-level configuration of this option is unusual, and when `true` in the global config it overrides the project-specific value. (Not commonly used now that much-faster Mutagen is available.)                                                                                                                                                    |

| host_https_port                  | Specific, persistent HTTPS port for direct binding to localhost interface                 | Not commonly used. Can be a specific port number for a fixed HTTPS URL. If unset, the port will change each time `ddev start` is run.<br><br>Example: `59001` will have the project always use `https://127.0.0.1:59001` for the localhost URL—used less commonly than the named URL which is better to rely on.                                                                                                                            |
| host_webserver_port              | Specific, persistent HTTP port for direct binding to localhost interface                  | Not commonly used. Can be a specific port number for a fixed HTTP URL. If unset, the port will change each time `ddev start` is run.<br><br>Example: `59000` will have the project always use `http://127.0.0.1:59000` for the localhost URL—used less commonly than the named URL which is better to rely on.                                                                                                                              |

(May still be easier to use `ddev mysql`, `ddev psql`, `ddev sequelpro`, etc., which handle changing ports automatically, as does the sample command `ddev mysqlworkbench`.)                                                                                                                                  |

When `true`, project will not be mounted by DDEV into the web container. Enables experimentation with alternate file mounting strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| default_container_timeout        | Seconds DDEV will wait for all containers to become ready                                 | Defaults to `120`. Not usually changed, but can be adjusted to avoid timeouts on slower systems or for huge snapshot restores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| override_config                  | Whether to override config values instead of merging                                      | Defaults to `false`. When `true`, the `config.*.yaml` file with the option will have its settings *override* rather than *merge with* others. Allows statements like `nfs_mount_enabled: false` or `additional_hostnames: []` to work.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## global_config.yaml Options

The `$HOME/.ddev/global_config.yaml` file has a few key global config options.

| Option                          | Description                                                                                             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nfs_mount_enabled               | Whether to globally enable NFS mounting for all projects                                                | Only `true` has any effect. When `true`, NFS will be used on all projects, regardless of any settings in the individual projects. (Rarely used since Mutagen is widely used and much faster.)
| project_tld                     | Set global `project_tld`.  Defaults to `ddev.site` so project URLs are normally `someproject.ddev.site` | Can be changed to anything that works for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | |
| mutagen_enabled                 | Whether to globally enable Mutagen asynchronous caching for all projects                                | When `true`, Mutagen will be used on all projects. This overrides NFS mounting as it’s incompatible with NFS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| table-style                     | Style for `ddev list` and `ddev describe` output                                                        | Can be `default`, `bold`, and `bright`. `bright` is a pleasant, colorful output some people may prefer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| simple-formatting               | Whether to disable most `ddev list` and `ddev describe` table formatting                                | Defaults to `false`. When `true`, turns off most table formatting in `ddev list` and `ddev describe` and suppresses colorized text everywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| fail_on_hook_fail               | Whether to interrupt `ddev start` hook failure globally for all projects                                | Defaults to `false`. When `true`, enables `ddev start` interruption globally for all projects when a [hook](hooks.md) fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| omit_containers                 | Containers every project should not load                                                                | Can include `dba` and `ddev-ssh-agent`. Example: `omit_containers: [ "dba", "ddev-ssh-agent"]`. You cannot omit the `db` container in the global configuration, only the per-project `.ddev/config.yaml`.                                                                                                                                     |
| web_environment                 | Additional custom environment variables for every project’s web container                               | Example: `web_environment: ["SOMEENV=someval", "SOMEOTHERENV=someotherval"]`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| instrumentation_opt_in          | Whether to allow instrumentation reporting                                                              | When `true` (default), anonymous usage information is collected via [Segment](https://segment.com).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| router_bind_all_interfaces      | Whether to bind on all network interfaces                                                               | Defaults to `false`. When `true`, `ddev-router` will bind on all network interfaces instead of only `localhost`, exposing DDEV projects to your local network. If you set this to `true`, consider setting `omit_containers: ["dba"]` so phpMyAdmin is not available.                                                                         |
| disable_http2                   | Whether to disable http/2 listen in `ddev-router`                                                       | Defaults to `false`. When `true`, nginx will not listen for http/2, but just use http/1.1 SSL. (Some browsers don’t work well with http/2.)                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| internet_detection_timeout_ms   | Internet detection timeout in milliseconds                                                              | Defaults to `1000` (1 second). DDEV must detect whether the internet is working to determine whether to add hostnames to `/etc/hosts`. In rare cases you may need to increase this value if you have slow but working internet. See [FAQ](../basics/faq.md) and [GitHub issue](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/2409#issuecomment-662448025). |
| use_hardened_images             | Whether to use hardened images for internet deployment                                                  | Defaults to `false`. When `true`, more secure hardened images are used for an internet deployment. These do not include sudo in the web container, and the container is run without elevated privileges. Generally used with the experimental casual hosting feature.                                                                         |
| use_letsencrypt                 | Whether to enable Let’s Encrypt integration                                                             | Defaults to `false` and may also be set via `ddev global --use-letsencrypt` or `ddev global --use-letsencrypt=false`. When `true`, `letsencrypt_email` must also be set and the system must be available on the internet. Used with casual web hosting feature.                                                                               |
| letsencrypt_email               | Email associated with Let’s Encrypt feature                                                             | Set with `ddev global --letsencrypt-email=me@example.com`. Used with experimental casual hosting feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| developer_mode                  | Whether to enable developer mode                                                                        | Not currently used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| required_docker_compose_version | Specific docker-compose version for download                                                            | If set to `v2.8.0`, for example, it will download and use that version instead of the expected version for docker-compose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| use_docker_compose_from_path    | Whether to use the system-installed docker-compose                                                      | Defaults to `false`. When `true`, DDEV will use the docker-compose found in on your system’s path instead of using its private, known-good, docker-compose version.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| no_bind_mounts                  | Whether to not use Docker bind mounts                                                                   | Defaults to `false`. Some Docker environments (like remote Docker) do not allow bind mounts, so when `true` this turns those off, turns on Mutagen, and uses volume copies to do what bind mounts would otherwise do.                                                                                                                         |
