# Router Customization and Debugging (Traefik)

Traefik is the default router in DDEV v1.22+. The older `nginx-proxy` router is deprecated and will be removed in DDEV v1.24.

DDEV’s router plays an important role in its [container architecture](../usage/architecture.md#container-architecture), receiving HTTP and HTTPS traffic for requests like `*.ddev.site` and delivering them to the relevant project’s web container.

DDEV uses Traefik by default unless you configure the (deprecated) `nginx-proxy` router by running `ddev poweroff && ddev config global --router=nginx-proxy`.

## Traefik Configuration

Before continuing, it's important to note that **very few users ever experiment with custom Traefik configuration**. This is an advanced topic, and the vast majority of users never need to know anything about it, as DDEV generates all of the necessary configuration. An understanding of Traefik configuration is required.

You can fully customize the router’s [Traefik configuration](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/configuration-overview/). (DDEV uses the Traefik `v2` rule syntax by default, `defaultRuleSyntax: v2`. However, any custom router configuration can use `ruleSyntax: v3` to override this.)

All Traefik configuration uses the *file* provider, not the *Docker* provider. Even though the Traefik daemon itself is running inside the `ddev-router` container, it uses mounted files for configuration, rather than listening to the Docker socket.

!!!tip
    Like other DDEV configuration, any file with `#ddev-generated` will be overwritten unless you choose to “take over” it yourself. You can do this by removing the `#ddev-generated` line. DDEV will stop making changes to that file and you’ll be responsible for updating it.

### Traefik Static Configuration

Static configuration is automatically generated in the `~/.ddev/traefik` directory. "Static" configuration means Traefik configuration which is only read when the router is started.

* `.static_config.yaml` is the base configuration, generated by DDEV, and not to be edited. It is read on router startup, and does not change after that.
* Additional static configuration may be added by adding a `static_config.*.yaml` file, which will be appended to the generated `.static_config.yaml`.
* `certs/default_cert.*` files are the default DDEV-generated certificates, normally created by `mkcert`.
* `config/default_config.yaml` contains global dynamic configuration, including pointers to the default certificates. It is possible to add other Traefik configuration in the `config` directory, which will apply to all projects. For example, a `config/router_middlewares.yaml` file might provide middleware implementations that would apply to all projects.

### Project Traefik Configuration

Project-specific configuration is automatically generated in the project’s `.ddev/traefik/config` directory. For example, a project named `example` will have a `.ddev/traefik/config/example.yaml` which describes the routers, middlewares, and services generated by default for that project. These are based on the base hostname, `additional_hostnames`, and `additional_fqdns` defined for the project. They also include support for add-ons and services that use `HTTP_EXPOSE`, `HTTPS_EXPOSE`, and `VIRTUAL_HOST` configurations.

* The `certs` directory contains the `<projectname>.crt` and `<projectname>.key` certificate generated for the project.
* The `config/<projectname>.yaml` file contains the configuration for the project, including information about routers, services, and certificates.
    * If you alter a `config/<projectname>.yaml` file, you need to remove the `#ddev-generated` from the top of the file, so it won't be overwritten on the next `ddev start`.
    * It is possible to add additional files in `config` that you own and manage that add additional facilities. For example, a `config/example_middlewares.yaml` would be read by the router and used. It's important that the filename be keyed by the project name, and usually its contents need to be unique to the project. For example, if it defines middleware implementations, they should usually be limited to the project. For example, an extra file might be:

      ```yaml
      http:
        middlewares:
          example-redirectHttps:
            redirectScheme:
              scheme: https
              permanent: true
      ```

## Debugging Traefik Routing

Traefik provides a dynamic description of its configuration you can visit at `http://localhost:10999`.
When things seem to be going wrong, run [`ddev poweroff`](../usage/commands.md#poweroff) and then start your project again by running [`ddev start`](../usage/commands.md#start). Examine the router’s logs to see what the Traefik daemon is doing (or failing at) by running `docker logs ddev-router` or `docker logs -f ddev-router`.

## Router `docker-compose` Customization

The default configuration for the router is found in `~/.ddev/.router-compose.yaml`. It is quite unusual to override this configuration, but it can be overridden in the same way project configuration can be overridden (project `.ddev/docker-compose.*.yaml`). These ultimately get merged into `~/.ddev/.router-compose-full.yaml`

You can create a `~/.ddev/router-compose.*.yaml`. For example, as `~/.ddev/router-compose.cloudflare.yaml` might contain environment variables like this:

```yaml
services:
  ddev-router:
    environment:
      - CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=you@example.com
      - CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=some-key
```
