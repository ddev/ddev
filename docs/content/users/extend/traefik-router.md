# Router Customization and Debugging (Traefik)

Traefik is the default router in DDEV v1.22+. The older `nginx-proxy` router is deprecated, no longer receives automated test coverage, and will be removed in DDEV v1.24.

DDEV’s router plays an important role in its [container architecture](../usage/architecture.md#container-architecture), receiving HTTP and HTTPS traffic for requests like `*.ddev.site` and delivering them to the relevant project’s web container.

DDEV uses Traefik by default unless you configure the (deprecated) `nginx-proxy` router by running `ddev poweroff && ddev config global --router=nginx-proxy`.

## Traefik Configuration

Before continuing, it's important to note that **very few users ever experiment with custom Traefik configuration**. This is an advanced topic, and the vast majority of users never need to know anything about it, as DDEV generates all the necessary configuration. An understanding of Traefik configuration is required.

You can fully customize the router’s [Traefik configuration](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/configuration-overview/). (DDEV uses the Traefik `v2` rule syntax by default, `defaultRuleSyntax: v2`. However, any custom router configuration can use `ruleSyntax: v3` to override this.)

All Traefik configuration uses the _file_ provider, not the _Docker_ provider. Even though the Traefik daemon itself is running inside the `ddev-router` container, it uses mounted files for configuration, rather than listening to the Docker socket.

!!!tip
Like other DDEV configuration, any file with `#ddev-generated` will be overwritten unless you choose to “take over” it yourself. You can do this by removing the `#ddev-generated` line. DDEV will stop making changes to that file and you’ll be responsible for updating it.

### Traefik Static Configuration

Static configuration is automatically generated in the `~/.ddev/traefik` directory. "Static" configuration means Traefik configuration which is only read when the router is started.

- `.static_config.yaml` (a hidden file) is the configuration that gets used. It is not to be edited; it is generated from DDEV's base configuration while merging any files named `static_config.*.yaml`. It is read on router startup, and does not change until the router starts again (normally after `ddev poweroff`).
- Additional static configuration may be added by adding `static_config.*.yaml` files, which will be merged into the generated `.static_config.yaml`. For example, a `static_config.plugins.yaml` might contain external Traefik plugins, or a `static_config.dnschallenge.yaml` might provide configuration for additional `certificatesResolvers`. Merging is done with an **override** strategy, meaning that the final file in alphanumeric sort to touch a particular element of the YAML structure wins.
  Some examples of `static_config.*.yaml` files are:

    - `static_config.cloudflare.yaml`:

      ```yaml
      certificatesResolvers:
        acme-dnsChallenge:
          acme:
            email: admin@example.com
            dnsChallenge:
              provider: cloudflare
      ```

    - `static_config.plugins.yaml`

      ```yaml
      experimental:
        plugins:
          fail2ban:
            moduleName: "github.com/tomMoulard/fail2ban"
            version: "v0.8.1"
      ```

- `certs/default_cert.*` files are the default DDEV-generated certificates, normally created by `mkcert`.
- `config/default_config.yaml` contains global _dynamic_ configuration, including pointers to the default certificates. It is possible to add other Traefik configuration in the `config` directory, which will apply to all projects. For example, a `config/router_middlewares.yaml` file might provide middleware implementations that would apply to all projects.

### Project Traefik Configuration

Project-specific configuration is automatically generated in the project’s `.ddev/traefik/config` directory. For example, a project named `example` will have a `.ddev/traefik/config/example.yaml` which describes the routers, middlewares, and services generated by default for that project. These are based on the base hostname, `additional_hostnames`, and `additional_fqdns` defined for the project. They also include support for add-ons and services that use `HTTP_EXPOSE`, `HTTPS_EXPOSE`, and `VIRTUAL_HOST` configurations.

- The `certs` directory contains the `<projectname>.crt` and `<projectname>.key` certificate generated for the project.
- The `config/<projectname>.yaml` file contains the configuration for the project, including information about routers, services, and certificates.
    - You can modify a project's dynamic configuration by adding `dynamic_config.*.yaml` files to `.ddev/traefik/`. These will be merged with an alphanumeric sort **override** strategy, so anything that is needed can be added or replaced.
    - An example `.ddev/traefik/dynamic_config.middlewares.yaml.example` file is provided in `.ddev/traefik/`. It can be modified to define and assign different middlewares, as well as overriding any default parameters. Please see `.ddev/traefik/README.md` file for more details.

## Debugging Traefik Routing

Traefik provides a dynamic description of its configuration you can visit at `http://localhost:10999`.
When things seem to be going wrong, run [`ddev poweroff`](../usage/commands.md#poweroff) and then start your project again by running [`ddev start`](../usage/commands.md#start). Examine the router’s logs to see what the Traefik daemon is doing (or failing at) by running `docker logs ddev-router` or `docker logs -f ddev-router`.

## Router `docker-compose` Customization

The default Docker Compose configuration for the router container is found in `~/.ddev/.router-compose.yaml`. It is quite unusual to override this configuration, but it can be overridden in the same way project configuration can be overridden (project `.ddev/docker-compose.*.yaml`). These ultimately get merged into `~/.ddev/.router-compose-full.yaml`

You can create a `~/.ddev/router-compose.*.yaml`. For example, as `~/.ddev/router-compose.cloudflare.yaml` might contain environment variables like this:

```yaml
services:
  ddev-router:
    environment:
      - CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=you@example.com
      - CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=some-key
```
