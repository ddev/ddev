# Additional Service Configurations & Add-ons

DDEV projects can be extended using add-ons or custom Docker Compose services.

## DDEV Add-ons (Recommended)

Add-ons are pre-packaged extensions that provide services with automatic installation and configuration.

**See [Using Add-ons](using-add-ons.md) for:**

- Installing add-ons with `ddev add-on get`
- Managing and customizing add-ons
- Official add-on catalog

**See [Creating Add-ons](creating-add-ons.md) for:**

- Building your own add-ons
- Using PHP or Bash actions
- Publishing and sharing add-ons

## Custom Docker Compose Services

For specialized needs or deep customization, you can create custom services using `docker-compose.*.yaml` files.

**See [Custom Docker Compose Services](custom-docker-services.md) for:**

- Manual service configuration
- Advanced service patterns
- Converting services to add-ons
