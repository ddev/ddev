# What’s in the `.ddev` Directory?

It can be a little confusing trying to understand all the things that are in the project’s `.ddev` directory, this page offers a guided tour of its contents. You may have some directories or files that aren’t listed here, likely added by custom services. For example, if you see a `solr` directory, it probably pertains to a custom Solr [add-on service](../extend/additional-services.md)).

* `apache` directory: Apache configuration for those using `webserver_type: apache-fpm`. There are docs and the default configuration in there. See [Apache customization docs](../extend/customization-extendibility.md#providing-custom-apache-configuration).
* `commands` subdirectories: Contains DDEV shell commands, both built-in and custom, that can run on the host or inside any container. See [docs](../extend/custom-commands.md).
* `config.yaml` file: This is the basic configuration file for the project. Take a look at the comments below for suggestions about things you can do, or look in [docs](../configuration/config_yaml.md)).
* `config.*.yaml` files: You can add configuration here that overrides parts of `config.yaml`. This is nice for situations where one developer’s project needs one-off configuration. For example, you could turn on `nfs-mount-enabled` or `mutagen-enabled` or use a different database type. By default, these are gitignored and not get checked in. See [docs](../extend/customization-extendibility.md#extending-configyaml-with-custom-configyaml-files).
* `db-build` directory: Can be used to provide a custom Dockerfile for the database container.
* `db_snapshots` directory: This is where snapshots go when you `ddev snapshot`. If you don’t need these backups, you can delete anything there at any time. See [snapshot docs](../basics/cli-usage.md#snapshotting-and-restoring-a-database).
* `docker-compose.*.yaml` files: Advanced users can provide their own services or service overrides using `docker-compose.*.yaml` files. See [custom compose files](../extend/custom-compose-files.md) and [additional services](../extend/additional-services.md). Also see the many examples in [ddev-contrib](https://github.com/drud/ddev-contrib).
* `homeadditions` directory: Anything you put in the `homeadditions` directory (including both files and directories) will be copied into the web container on startup. This lets you easily override the default home directory contents (`.profile`, `.bashrc`, `.composer`, `.ssh`) or anything you want to put in there. It could also include scripts that you want to have easily available inside the container. (You can do the same thing globally in `~/.ddev/homeadditions`.) See [homeadditions docs](../extend/in-container-configuration.md).
* `mutagen` directory: contains `mutagen/mutagen.yml` where you can override the default Mutagen configuration. See [mutagen docs](../install/performance.md#advanced-mutagen-configuration-options).
* `mysql` directory: contains optional `mysql` or `mariadb` configuration. See [MySQL docs](../extend/customization-extendibility.md#providing-custom-mysqlmariadb-configuration-mycnf).
* `nginx` directory: (deprecated) can be used for add-on nginx snippets.
* `nginx_full` directory: Contains the nginx configuration used by the web container, which can be customized following the instructions there. See [providing custom nginx configuration](../extend/customization-extendibility.md#providing-custom-nginx-configuration).
* `postgres` directory: contains `postgres/postgresql.conf`, which can be edited if needed. Remove the `#ddev-generated` line at the top to take it over.
* `providers` directory: Contains examples and implementations showing ways to configure DDEV so `ddev pull` can work. You can use `ddev pull` with [hosting providers](../providers/index.md) like Acquia, Platform.sh, or Pantheon, as well as with local files or custom database/files sources.
* `web-build` directory: You can add a custom Dockerfile that adds things into the Docker image used for your web container. See [Customizing images](../extend/customizing-images.md).
* `xhprof` directory: Contains the `xhprof_prepend.php` file that can be used to customize [xhprof](../debugging-profiling/xhprof-profiling.md) behavior for different types of websites.

## Things Not to Look at or Mess With :)

The hidden files (that begin with a `.` are not intended to be fiddled with, and are hidden for that reason. Most are regenerated, and thus overwritten, on every `ddev start`:

* `.dbimageBuild` directory: The generated Dockerfile used to customize the `db` container on first start.
* `.ddev-docker-compose-base.yaml`: The base docker-compose file used to describe a project.
* `.ddev-docker-compose-full.yaml`: This is the result of preprocessing `.ddev-docker-compose-base.yaml` using `docker-compose config`. Mostly it replaces environment variables with their values.
* `.gitignore`: The `.gitignore` is generated by DDEV and should generally not be edited or checked in. (It gitignores itself to make sure you don’t check it in.) It’s generated on every `ddev start` and will change as DDEV versions change, so if you check it in by accident it will always be showing changes that you don’t need to see in `git status`.
* `.global_commands`: This is a temporary directory used to get global commands available inside a project. You shouldn’t ever have to look there.
* `.homeadditions`: This is a temporary directory used to consolidate global `homeadditions` with project-level `homeadditions`. You shouldn’t ever have to look here.
* `.webimageBuild` directory: The generated Dockerfile used to customize the web container on first start.
