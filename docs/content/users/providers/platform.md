# Platform.sh Integration

DDEV provides integration with the [Platform.sh Website Management Platform](https://platform.sh/), which allows Platform.sh users to quickly download and provision a project from Platform.sh in a local DDEV-managed environment.

!!!tip
    Consider using `ddev get ddev/ddev-platformsh` ([platformsh/ddev-platformsh](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-platformsh)) for more complete Platform.sh integration.

DDEV’s Platform.sh integration pulls databases and files from an existing Platform.sh site/environment into your local system so you can develop locally.

## Platform.sh Global Configuration

You need to obtain and configure an API token first. This is only needed once.

1. Login to the Platform.sh Dashboard and go to *Account* → *API Tokens*. Create an API token DDEV can use.
2. Add the API token to the `web_environment` section in your global DDEV configuration at `~/.ddev/global_config.yaml`:

```yaml
web_environment:
  - PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=abcdeyourtoken
```

## Platform.sh Per-Project Configuration

1. Check out the site from Platform.sh and configure it with [`ddev config`](../usage/commands.md#config). You’ll want to use [`ddev start`](../usage/commands.md#start) and make sure the basic functionality is working.
2. Add `PLATFORM_PROJECT` and `PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT` variables to your project.

    * Either in `.ddev/config.yaml` or a `.ddev/config.*.yaml` file:

        ```yaml
        web_environment:
        - PLATFORM_PROJECT=nf4amudfn23biyourproject
        - PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT=main
        ```

    * Or with a command from your terminal:

        ```bash
        ddev config --web-environment-add="PLATFORM_PROJECT=nf4amudfn23bi,PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT=main"
        ```

3. Run [`ddev restart`](../usage/commands.md#restart).
4. Run `ddev pull platform`. After you agree to the prompt, the current upstream databases and files will be downloaded.
5. Optionally use `ddev push platform` to push local files and database to Platform.sh. The [`ddev push`](../usage/commands.md#push) command can potentially damage your production site, so we don’t recommend using it.

### Managing Multiple Apps

If your environment contains more than one app, add `PLATFORM_APP` variable to your project:

* Either in `.ddev/config.yaml` or a `.ddev/config.*.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    web_environment:
    - ...
    - PLATFORM_APP=app
    ```

* Or with a command from your terminal:

    ```bash
    ddev config --web-environment-add="PLATFORM_APP=app"
    ```

### Managing Multiple Databases

If your project has only one database, it will automatically be pulled into and pushed from DDEV’s `'db'` database.

If your project has multiple databases, they’ll all be pulled into DDEV with their respective remote names. You can optionally designate a *primary* to use DDEV’s default `'db'` database, which may be useful in some cases—particularly if you’ve been using the default solo-database behavior and happened to add another one to your project.

You can designate the primary database using the `PLATFORM_PRIMARY_RELATIONSHIP` environment variable:

```
ddev config --web-environment-add="PLATFORM_PRIMARY_RELATIONSHIP=main"
```

You can also do the same thing by running `ddev pull platform` and using the `--environment` flag:

```
ddev pull platform --environment="PLATFORM_PRIMARY_RELATIONSHIP=main"
```

## Usage

* `ddev pull platform` will connect to Platform.sh to download database and files. To skip downloading and importing either file or database assets, use the `--skip-files` and `--skip-db` flags.
* If you need to change the `platform.yaml` recipe, you can change it to suit your needs, but remember to remove the `#ddev-generated` line from the top of the file.
