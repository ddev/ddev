# Get Started with DDEV

[DDEV](https://github.com/drud/ddev) is an open source tool for launching local PHP development environments in minutes.

These environments can be extended, version controlled, and shared, so you can take advantage of a Docker workflow without Docker experience or bespoke configuration. Projects can be changed, powered down, or removed just as easily as they’re started.
