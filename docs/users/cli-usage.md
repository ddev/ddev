## Quickstart Guides

You can start using ddev with any site just by running a few commands.

Below are quickstart instructions Wordpress, Drupal 7, and Drupal 8.

**Prerequisites:** If you do not have ddev already on your machine, please follow the [installation instructions](../index.md#installation) before beginning the quickstart tutorials. 

### Wordpress Quickstart
To get started using ddev with a Wordpress site, simply clone the site's repository and checkout its directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/user/worpress-site
cd wordpress-site
```

From here we can start setting up ddev. Inside of your site's working directory, enter the command:

```
ddev config
```

_Note: ddev config will prompt you for a site name, docroot, and app type._

After you've run `ddev config`, you're ready to start running your site. To start running ddev, simply enter:

```
ddev start
``` 

When running `ddev start` you should see output informing you that the site's environment is being started. If startup is successful, you'll see a message like the one below telling you where the site can be reached.

```
Successfully started wordpress-site
Your application can be reached at: http://wordpress-site.ddev.local
```

Quickstart instructions regarding database imports, can be found under [Database Imports](#database-imports).

### Drupal 7 Quickstart

Beginning to use ddev with a Drupal 7 site is as simple as cloning the site's repository and checking out its directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/user/my-drupal7-site
cd my-drupal7-site
```

Now to start working with ddev. Inside of your site's working directory, enter the following command:

```
ddev config
```

_Note: ddev config will prompt you for a site name, docroot, and app type._

After you've run `ddev config` you're ready to start running your site. Run ddev using a simple:

```
ddev start
``` 

When running `ddev start` you should see output informing you that the site's environment is being started. If startup is successful, you'll see a message like the one below telling you where the site can be reached.

```
Successfully started my-drupal7-site
Your application can be reached at: http://my-drupal7-site.ddev.local
```

Quickstart instructions regarding database imports, can be found under [Database Imports](#database-imports).

### Drupal 8 Quickstart

You can get started with Drupal 8 sites on ddev either by cloning a git repository or using a new or existing composer project.

**Git Clone Example**

```
git clone https://github.com/user/my-drupal8-site
cd my-drupal8-site
```

**Composer Setup Example**

```
composer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev my-drupal8-site --stability dev --no-interaction
cd my-drupal8-site
```

_You can find more information on composer and how to use it [here](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project)._

The next step is to configure ddev. Inside of your site's working directory, enter the following command:

```
ddev config
```

_Note: ddev config will prompt you for a site name, docroot, and app type._

After you've run `ddev config` you're ready to start running your site. Run ddev using a simple:

```
ddev start
``` 

When running `ddev start` you should see output informing you that the site's environment is being started. If startup is successful, you'll see a message like the one below telling you where the site can be reached.

```
Successfully started my-drupal8-site
Your application can be reached at: http://my-drupal8-site.ddev.local
```

### Database Imports

**Important:** Before importing any databases for your site, please remove its' wp-config.php if using Worpress - or settings.php file in the case of Drupal 7/8, if present. 

_ddev will create its own wp_config.php or settings.php file automatically._

We're happy to say that importing a database into a site running on ddev is painless. 

Database imports can be accomplished using one command. And we currently offer support for several file types. Including: **.sql, sql.gz, tar, tar.gz, and zip**.

Here's an example of a database import using ddev:

```
ddev import-db --src=dumpfile.sql.gz
```

The `import-db` command will produce output so you can monitor the progress of the database import. 

For more in depth application monitoring, use the `ddev describe` command to see details about the status of your ddev app.


## Getting Started

Check out the git repository for the site you want to work on. `cd` into the directory and run `ddev config` and follow the prompts.

```
$ cd ~/Projects
$ composer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev drupal8 --stability dev --no-interaction
$ cd drupal8
$ ddev config
Creating a new ddev project config in the current directory (/Users/username/Projects/drupal8)
Once completed, your configuration will be written to /Users/username/Projects/drupal8/.ddev/config.yaml


Project name (drupal8):

The docroot is the directory from which your site is served. This is a relative path from your application root (/Users/username/Projects/drupal8)
You may leave this value blank if your site files are in the application root
Docroot Location: web
Found a drupal8 codebase at /Users/username/Projects/drupal8/web
```

Configuration files have now been created for your site. (Available for inspection/modification at .ddev/ddev.yaml).

Now that the configuration has been created, you can start your site with `ddev start` (still from within the project working directory):

```
$ ddev start

Starting environment for drupal8...
Creating local-drupal8-db
Creating local-drupal8-web
Waiting for the environment to become ready. This may take a couple of minutes...
Successfully started drupal8
Your application can be reached at: http://drupal8.ddev.local
```

And you can now visit your working site. Enjoy!

## Listing site information

To see a list of your current sites you can use `ddev list`.

```
➜  ddev list
1 local site found.
NAME     TYPE     LOCATION                 URL                        STATUS
drupal8  drupal8  ~/Projects/ddev/drupal8  http://drupal8.ddev.local  running
```

You can also see more detailed information about a site by running `ddev describe` from its working directory. You can also run `ddev describe [site-name]` from any location to see the detailed information for a running site.

```
NAME     TYPE     LOCATION                 URL                        STATUS

## Importing assets for an existing site

An important aspect of local web development is the ability to have a precise recreation of the site you are working on locally, including up-to-date database contents and static assets such as uploaded images and files. ddev provides functionality to help with importing assets to your local environment with two commands.

### Importing a database

The `ddev import-db` command is provided for importing the MySQL database for a site. Running this command will provide a prompt for you to specify the location of your database import.

```
➜  ddev import-db
Provide the path to the database you wish to import.
Import path:
~/Downloads/db.sql
Importing database...
Generating settings.php file for database connection.
Successfully imported database for drupal8
```

A database connection file will be generated for your site if one does not exist (`settings.php` for Drupal, `wp-config.php` for WordPress). If you have already created a connection file, you will need to ensure your connection credentials match the ones provided in `ddev describe`.

<h4>Supported file types</h4>

Database import supports the following file types:

- Raw SQL Dump (.sql)
- Gzipped SQL Dump (.sql.gz)
- (Gzipped) Tarball Archive (.tar, .tar.gz, .tgz)
- Zip Archive (.zip)

If a Tarball Archive or Zip Archive is provided for the import, you will be provided an additional prompt, allowing you to specify a path within the archive to use for the import asset. The specified path should provide a Raw SQL Dump (.sql). In the following example, the database we want to import is named data.sql and resides at the top-level of the archive:

```
➜  ddev import-db
Provide the path to the database you wish to import.
Import path:
~/Downloads/site-backup.tar.gz
You provided an archive. Do you want to extract from a specific path in your archive? You may leave this blank if you wish to use the full archive contents
Archive extraction path:
data.sql
Importing database...
A settings file already exists for your application, so ddev did not generate one.
Run 'ddev describe' to find the database credentials for this application.
Successfully imported database for drupal8
```

<h4>Non-interactive usage</h4>
If you want to use import-db without answering prompts, you can use the `--src` flag to provide the path to the import asset. If you are importing an archive, and wish to specify the path within the archive to extract, you can use the `--extract-path` flag in conjunction with the `--src` flag.

### Importing static file assets
The `ddev import-files` command is provided for importing the static file assets for a site, such as uploaded images and documents. Running this command will provide a prompt for you to specify the location of your asset import. The assets will then be imported to the default public upload directory of the platform for the site. For Drupal sites, this is the "sites/default/files" directory. For WordPress sites, this is the "wp-content/uploads" directory. 

```
➜  ddev import-files
Provide the path to the directory or archive you wish to import. Please note, if the destination directory exists, it will be replaced with the import assets specified here.
Import path:
~/Downloads/files.tar.gz
Successfully imported files for drupal8
```

<h4>Supported file types</h4>

Static asset import supports the following file types:

- A directory containing static assets
- (Gzipped) Tarball Archive (.tar, .tar.gz, .tgz)
- Zip Archive (.zip)

If a Tarball Archive or Zip Archive is provided for the import, you will be provided an additional prompt, allowing you to specify a path within the archive to use for the import asset. In the following example, the assets we want to import reside at "web/sites/default/files":

```
➜  ddev import-files
Provide the path to the directory or archive you wish to import. Please note, if the destination directory exists, it will be replaced with the import assets specified here.
Import path:
~/Downloads/site-backup.tar.gz
You provided an archive. Do you want to extract from a specific path in your archive? You may leave this blank if you wish to use the full archive contents
Archive extraction path:
web/sites/default/files
Successfully imported files for drupal8
```

<h4>Non-interactive usage</h4>
If you want to use import-files without answering prompts, you can use the `--src` flag to provide the path to the import asset. If you are importing an archive, and wish to specify the path within the archive to extract, you can use the `--extract-path` flag in conjunction with the `--src` flag.

## Interacting with your Site
ddev provides several commands to facilitate interacting with your site in the development environment. These commands can be run within the working directory of your project while the site is running in ddev. 

### Executing Commands in Containers
The `ddev exec` command allows you to run shell commands in the container for a ddev service. By default, commands are executed on the web service container, in the docroot path of your site. This allows you to use [the developer tools included in the web container](developer-tools.md). For example, to run the Drush CLI in the web container, you would run `ddev exec drush status`.

To run a shell command in the container for a different service, use the `--service` flag at the beginning of your exec command to specify the service the command should be run against. For example, to run the mysql client in the database, container, you would run `ddev exec --service db mysql`.

Commands can also be executed using the shorter `ddev . <cmd>` alias.

### SSH Into Containers
The `ddev ssh` command will open an interactive bash shell session to the container for a ddev service. The web service is connected to by default. The session can be ended by typing `exit`. To connect to another service, use the `--service` flag to specify the service you want to connect to. For example, to connect to the database container, you would run `ddev ssh --service db`.

### Log Access
The `ddev logs` command allows you to easily retrieve error logs from the web server. To follow the web server error log (watch the lines in real time), run `ddev logs -f`. When you are done, press CTRL+C to exit from the log trail.

Additional logging can be accessed by using `ddev ssh` to manually review the log files you are after. The web server stores access logs at `/var/log/nginx/access.log`, and PHP-FPM logs at `/var/log/php7.0-fpm.log`.

## Stopping a site
You can stop a site's containers without losing data by using `ddev stop` in the working directory of the site. You can also stop any running site's containers by providing the site name as an argument, e.g. `ddev stop <sitename>`.

## Removing a site
You can remove a site's containers by running `ddev remove` in the working directory of the site. You can also remove any running site's containers by providing the site name as an argument, e.g. `ddev remove <sitename>`. **Note:** `ddev remove` is destructive. It will remove all containers for the site, destroying database contents in the process. Your project code base and files will not be affected.

## ddev Command Auto-Completion
ddev bash auto-completion is available. If you have installed ddev via homebrew (on OSX) it will already be installed. Otherwise, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases) tarball for your platform and the ddev_bash_completions.sh inside it can be installed wherever your bash_completions.d is. For example, `cp ddev_bash_completions.sh /etc/bash_completion.d/ddev`
