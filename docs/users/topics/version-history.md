- [x] [Support ngrok to allow web access remotely](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/375)
- [x] [Hook system overhaul](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/1372)

### v1.8 (released 2019-05-14)

- **Browsers and host OSs now trust ddev sites over https**. You do have to take the one-time action to install the CA keys into your operating system and browsers: `mkcert -install`. If you use one of the package installation methods or the WIndows installer, you should already have mkcert. Otherwise, see the [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) page for installation options.  (Even curl and operating system tools generally trust the mkcert certs, and curl within the container also trusts them.)
- **Dynamic container updates**: If you need extra Debian packages in your web or db container (or need to make more sophisticated adjustments) you no longer have to wait for them, or install them every time you start a project.  You can add [`webimage_extra_packages`](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/customizing-images/#adding-extra-debian-packages-with-webimage_extra_packages-and-dbimage_extra_packages) to your config.yaml or  [build a free-form Dockerfile](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/customizing-images/#adding-extra-dockerfiles-for-webimage-and-dbimage) (Dockerfile.example provided in your .ddev folder)
- **nginx configuration in the web container has been reorganized** and simplified. This mostly won't matter to you unless you use custom nginx configuration, in which case you'll want to upgrade your configuration (see below). [docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/customization-extendibility/#providing-custom-nginx-configuration)
- **`ddev exec` and exec hooks now interpret commands using bash**. This means you can have a hook like "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y some-package" without putting "bash -c" in front of it. And you can `ddev exec "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y some-package"` as well, no bash -c required.
- **`ddev exec` can now work with interactive situations**. So for example, you can `ddev exec mysql` and interact with the mysql program directly.  Or `ddev exec bash`, which is the same as `ddev ssh`.

### v1.7 (released 2019-03-28)

- config.*.yaml overrides: local configuration files can be used to override a team-standard checked-in .ddev/config.yaml. See [docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/customization-extendibility/#extending-configyaml-with-custom-configyaml-files).  #1504 and #1410.
- Optional static bind ports for db and webserver containers. Those who want the dbserver or webserver bound port to be static within a project can use `host_db_port` or `host_webserver_port` to specify it: #1502, #1491, #941

- Previous versions of Docker for Mac supported operating systems back to El Capitan, but Docker-for-Mac has dropped support for anything before macOS Sierra 10.12, so ddev also has to drop support for everything before Sierra.
- The default PHP version changes to 7.2. This affects new Drupal 8 and Drupal 7 projects, as well as projects of type "php".
- Fix regression in v1.5.0 where mariadb_version = 10.1 did not properly set the container version to the 10.1 container version.
- The ddev-dbserver images now use the official MariaDB docker image (which uses Debian) as a base, instead of building a custom Alpine image. This *should* be invisible to all users, but we love to hear feedback.

### v1.6 (released 2019-02-11)

- ddev now supports) NFS mounting into the container on all platforms.  This provides nearly the speed increase of the experimental webcache feature, but with far greater reliability, and it works on all platforms. In addition, it seems to solve perpetual symlink problems that windows users had. It does require some configuration on the host side, so [please read the docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/performance/#using-nfs-to-mount-the-project-into-the-container)
- Chocolatey installs on Windows: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is a leading package manager for Windows, and it makes so many packages so easy to install. On our Windows testbots we use choco to install all the key items that a testbot needs with `choco install -y git mysql-cli golang make docker-desktop nssm GoogleChrome zip jq composer cmder netcat ddev`, note that ddev is in there now :).
- The ddev-dbserver container has been updated so that triggers work, for those of you who use triggers.
- Root/sudo usage of ddev is prevented  (#1407). We found that people kept getting themselves in trouble by trying to use sudo and then they would have files that could not be accessed by an ordinary user.

### v1.5 (released 2018-12-18)

- The newly released PHP 7.3 is now supported, `php_version: 7.3` or `ddev config --php-version=7.3`. As noted above, php-memcached is not yet available for 7.3.
- For macOS users, a new *experimental* webcaching strategy makes webserving way faster on large projects like TYPO3 or Drupal 8. `webcache_enabled: true` in the config.yaml will start a caching container so that actual webserving happens on a much faster filesystem. This is experimental and has some risks, we want to know your experience. It takes longer to do a `ddev start` because your entire project has to be pushed into the container, but after that hitting a page is way, way more satisfying.  Note that `.git` directories are not copied into the webcache, git won't work inside the web container. It just seemed too risky to combine 2-way file synchronization with your precious git repository, so do git operations on the host. Note that if you have a lot of files or big files in your repo, they have to be pushed into the container, and that can take time. I have had to clean up my .ddev/db_snapshots directory rather than wait for the `docker cp` to happen forever. A big shout out to Drud team member @cweagans for the original [docker-bg-sync](https://github.com/cweagans/docker-bg-sync) that we forked and used to implement this! Thanks!
- Important Windows symlink support in `ddev composer` (<https://github.com/drud/ddev/pull/1323>). On the CIFS filesystem used by Docker-for-Windows, real Linux/Mac symlinks are *supported* but cannot be created, so composer operations inside the container in some cases create simulated symlinks, which are actually just files with XSym content; these work fine inside the container… but they're not real symlinks and sometimes cause some issues. We've added a cleanup step after `ddev composer` that converts those XSym files into real symlinks. It only works on Docker for Windows, and it only works if you have "Developer mode" enabled on your Windows 10 Pro host. More info is in the [docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/developer-tools/#ddev-and-composer)

### v1.4 (released 2018-11-15)

- The `ddev composer` command now provides in-container composer commands for nearly anything you'd want to do with composer. We found that lots of people, and especially WIndows users, were having trouble with fairly difficult workarounds to use composer. However this has value to most ddev users:
    - The composer and php version used are the exact version configured for your project.
    - Your composer project will be configured for the OS it's actually running (Linux in the container). This was a serious problem for Windows users, as `composer install` on Windows OS did not result in the same results as `composer install` in Linux, even if symlinks were working.
    - Note that because of problems with symlinks on Windows, it is *not* recommended to use code from the host (Windows) side, or to check it in. That means it will not be appropriate to check in the vendor directory on the host (although it would be safe inside the container), but most people do a composer build anyway.
    - The `ddev composer create` command is almost the same as `composer create-project` but we couldn't make it exactly the same. See [docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/developer-tools/#ddev-and-composer) for its usage.
- Composer caching: composer downloads are now cached in a shared docker volume, making in-container composer builds far faster.
- Shared ssh authentication in web container: You can now `ddev auth ssh` to authenticate your keys in the automatically-started ddev-ssh-agent container, which shares auth information with ever project's web container. This allows access to private composer repositories without the pain of manually mounting ssh keys and authenticating each time you need them in each web container. It also allows easier use of facilities like `drush rsync` that need ssh auth.  This means that the previous [manual workaround for mounting ssh keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51065054/how-can-i-get-my-ssh-keys-and-identity-into-ddevs-web-container) is now obsolete. Please use `ddev auth ssh` instead.
- Configurable working and destination directories. You can now specify the container directory you land in with `ddev ssh`, `ddev exec`, and exec hooks in config.yaml  (#1214). This also means that TYPO3 users will land in the project root by default; Drupal/Backdrop users land in the project root by default.
- [`ddev export-db`](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#exporting-a-database) makes textual exports of the database easier; Don't forget about `ddev snapshot` as well.

### v1.3 (released 2018-10-11)

- Apache support now works on Windows and has full test coverage and is no longer experimental. It seems to work quite well.
- MariaDB is upgraded from 10.1 to 10.2. MariaDB 10.2 has a number of advantages including more flexible key lengths. (This does mean that pre-v1.1.0 databases which were bind-mounted in ~/.ddev can no longer be migrated to docker volumes with this release, see caveats above. Also, snapshots from previous releases cannot be restored with this release, in caveats above.)
- Automatic generation of WordPress wp-config.php has been improved and extra guidance provided for WordPress projects. (#1156)
- The webserver container logs format is improved and all key logs are now provided in `ddev logs`.
- The webserver container now gives significantly more information in its healthcheck information (use `docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health }}' ddev-<project>-web`). It also exits when one of its components is unhealthy, so that we all don't spend time debugging a broken container or broken add-on configuration.
- The dbserver container now provides full log information to `ddev logs -s db`.
- php-imagick, locales, and php*-sqlite3 and sqlite3 packages added to web container. You can now run a project with a sqlite3 database.
- It's now possible to access web/http/https URLs by name (including https) from within the web container. They get routed to the ddev-router, which sends them back to the right place. So `curl https://somesite.ddev.local:8443` will work inside the web container for a project configured with https on port 8443. (#1151)
- No php functions are now disabled in the php disable_functions configuration. (#1130)
- Drupal drush commands do not automatically use '-y' when issued inside the web container. They still do when used in exec hooks, so this should not break any exec hooks. (#1120)
- `ddev pull` now adds flags so you can skip downloading either files or db. See `ddev help pull`.
- A number of bugfixes, docs fixes, and significant automated testing improvements.

### v1.2 (released 2018-09-11)

- Experimental Apache support has been added, but it doesn't yet work on Windows. You can now run with apache-with-php-fpm (apache-fpm) or apache-with-cgi (apache-cgi). Just change your .ddev/config.yaml to use `webserver_type: apache-fpm` or `webserver_type: apache-cgi`. (#1007)
- `ddev config` now has additional config flags:  --php-version, --http-port,  --https-port, --xdebug-enabled,  --additional-hostnames, --additional-fqdns to allow command-line configuration instead of direct editing of the .ddev/config.yaml file. (#1092)
- The upload directory (Drupal public files directory, etc.) can now be specified in config.yaml. (#1093)

### v1.1 (released 2018-08-15)

- ddev now requires docker 18.06; a serious docker bug in 18.03 caused lots and lots of crashes, so we moved it up to 18.06.
- You can now remove hostnames that ddev has added to /etc/hosts.
    - `ddev remove --remove-data` removes the hostname(s) associated with the project
    - `sudo ddev hostname --remove-inactive` will remove from /etc/hosts all hostnames that are not currently active in a ddev project.
- The docker-compose version has been updated to 3.6, so any customized docker-compose.*.yaml files in your project must be updated to read `version: '3.6'`
- The project database is now stored in a docker volume instead of in the `~/.ddev/<project>/mysql` directory.  This means that on your first `ddev start` it will be migrated from the ~/.ddev file into a docker volume. The old `~/.ddev/<project>/mysql` will be renamed to `~/.ddev/<project>/mysql.bak`.
- Database snapshotting is now available. At any time you can create a snapshot (in mariabackup format) using `ddev snapshot` or `ddev snapshot --name <somename>`. That db snapshot can easily be restored later with `ddev restore-snapshot <somename>`. These are stored in the project's .ddev/db_snapshots directory.
- `ddev remove --remove-data` now creates a snapshot by default.
- For Drupal users, drush now works on the host for many commands (after you've done a `ddev config` and `ddev start`. So, for example, you can run `drush sql-cli` or `drush cr` on the *host* when you need it, rather than using `ddev exec` or `ddev ssh` to do it in the web container. This assumes you have drush available on the host of course.
- `ddev --import-files` now works on TYPO3 and Backdrop.
- ddev now has integration with the Drud hosting service, so `ddev config drud-s3` works for users of the Drud hosting service.
- Php-redis was added to web container.

### v1.0 (released 2018-07-19)

- Improvements of settings file management for Drupal and Backdrop (more below) (#468)
- Support for fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) (#868) - You can now add to your .ddev/config.yaml `additional_fqdns: ["mysite.example.com"]` and your site will be available at <http://mysite.example.com> after restart. More in [the docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/additional-hostnames/)
- Start, stop, and remove multiple (or all) projects at once (#952). You can `ddev rm project1 project2 project3` or `ddev rm --all`; it works with `ddev stop` as well, and with `ddev start` for running or stopped projects.
- Much better resilience when a project is running and the host is rebooted or docker is restarted, etc. This used to result in database corruption regularly on nontrivial databases, and seems to be much improved.
