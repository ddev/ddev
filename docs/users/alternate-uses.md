## Alternate Uses for DDEV-Local

### Continuous Integration (CI) for a project

Although it has not a primary goal of DDEV-Local, a number of people have found it easy to use DDEV-Local on a CI system like Github Actions or TravisCI or CircleCI to test out their projects. Instead of setting up a hosting environment for testing, they just start the project using DDEV and run their tests.

Examples of this approach are shown in [Codeception tests in Travis CI with DDEV and Selenium](https://dev.to/tomasnorre/codeception-tests-in-travis-ci-with-ddev-and-selenium-1607) and [Github Action Setup Ddev](https://github.com/jonaseberle/github-action-setup-ddev)

### Integration of DDEV-Local Docker Images Into Other Projects

It is possible to use DDEV-Local Docker images outside the context of the DDEV-Local environment. In the future we plan to share "hardened" images that share most of the characteristics of the regular DDEV-Local images, but pay more attention to security. For example, they will not have sudo installed inside them.

### Project Hosting on the Internet (including Let's Encrypt)

An experimental feature of DDEV-local is simplified small-project hosting on the internet. One can run DDEV-Local on an internet server and point their DNS to it and use it as a regular (though limited) hosting environment.

1. Install DDEV-Local on a regular Linux server that is directly connected to the Internet. You're responsible for your firewall and maintenance of the server, of course.
2. Use `ddev config global --router-bind-all-interfaces` to tell DDEV to listen to all network interfaces, not just localhost.
3. Use `ddev config global --use-hardened-images` to tell DDEV to use a hardened image which does not contain sudo, for example.
4. Use `ddev config global --use-letencrypt --letsencrypt-email=you@example.com` to configure Let's Encrypt.
5. Use a DNS provider to point a DNS name at the server.
6. Create your DDEV-Local project as you normally would, but `ddev config --project-tld=your-tld`. For example, if the top-level domain you're using were "ddev.example.com" you might use `ddev config --project-tld=ddev.example.com`
7. `ddev start` and visit your site.

To make ddev start sites on system boot, you'll want to set up a systemd unit on systemd systems like Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora. For example, a file named /etc/systemd/system/ddev.service containing:

```
# Start ddev when system starts (after docker)
# Stop ddev when docker shuts down
# Start with `sudo systemctl start ddev`
# Enable on boot with `sudo systemctl enable ddev`
# Make sure to edit the User= for your user and the
# full path to ddev on your system.
# Optionally give a list of sites instead of --all
[Unit]
Description=DDEV-Local sites
After=network.target
Requires=docker.service
PartOf=docker.service
[Service]
User=rfay
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ddev start --all
RemainAfterExit=true
ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/ddev poweroff

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Caveats:

* It's unknown how much traffic a given server and docker setup can sustain, or what the results will be if the traffic is more than the server can handle.
* DDEV-Local does not provide outgoing SMTP mailhandling service, and the development-focued MailHog feature is disabled if you're using `use_hardened_images`. You can provide SMTP service a number of ways, but the recommended way is to enable SMTP mailsending in your application and leverage a third-party transactional email service such as SendGrid, Mandrill, or Mailgun. This is the best way to make sure your mail actually gets delivered. See [DDEV-Live email sending docs](https://docs.ddev.com/services/#email) for hints.
* Debugging Let's Encrypt failures requires viewing the ddev-router logs with `docker logs ddev-router`
* A malicious attack on a website hosted with `use_hardened_images` will likely not be able to do anything significant to the host, but it can certainly change your code, which is mounted on the host.

When using `use_hardened_images` docker runs the webimage as an unprivileged user, and the container does not have sudo. However, any docker server hosted on the internet is a potential vulnerability. Keep your packages up-to-date. Make sure that your firewall does not allow access to ports other than (normally) 22, 80, and 443.
