## .ddev/config.yaml options

Each project has a (hidden) directory named .ddev, and
the .ddev/config.yaml is the primary configuration for the project.

* You can override the config.yaml with extra files named "config.\*.yaml". For example, many teams use `config.local.yaml` for configuration that is specific to one environment, and that is not intended to be checked into the team's default config.yaml.
* Most configuration options take effect on `ddev start`
* Nearly all configuration options have equivalent `ddev config` flags, so you can use ddev config instead of editing the config.yaml. See `ddev help config` to see all the flags.

Note that the bundled default version might be behind the latest available composer release. Alternatively, an explicit composer version may be specified, for example `composer_version: 1.0.22`. |
| nodejs_version                   | version of nodejs to use in web container as "system" version                             | It defaults to current LTS version; you can currently set it to "12", "14", "16", "17", "18".

| omit_containers                  | Allows the project to not load specified containers                                       | For example, `omit_containers: [db, dba, ddev-ssh-agent]`. Currently only these containers are supported. Some containers can also be omitted globally in the ~/.ddev/global_config.yaml and the result is additive; all containers named in both places will be omitted. Note that if you omit the "db" container, several standard features of ddev that access the database container will be unusable.                                   |
| web_environment                  | Set the DDEV-provided environment variables in the web container                          | For example, `web_environment: ["SOMEENV=someval", "SOMEOTHERENV=someotherval"]`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| nfs_mount_enabled                | Allows using NFS to mount the project into the container for performance reasons          | See [nfs_mount_enabled documentation](../performance.md). This requires configuration on the host before it can be used. Note that project-level configuration of nfs_mount_enabled is unusual, and that if it's true in the global config, that overrides the project-specific nfs_mount_enabled                                                                                                                                            |
| fail_on_hook_fail                | Decide whether `ddev start` should be interrupted by a failing hook                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| host_https_port                  | Specify a specific and persistent https port for direct binding to the localhost interface | This is not commonly used, but a specific port can be provided here and the https URL will always remain the same. For example, if you put "59001", the project will always use `https://127.0.0.1:59001"` for the localhost URL. (Note that the named URL is more commonly used and for most purposes is better.) If this is not set the port will change from `ddev start` to `ddev start`                                                 |
| host_webserver_port              | Specify a specific and persistent http port for direct binding to the localhost interface | This is not commonly used, but a specific port can be provided here and the https URL will always remain the same. For example, if you put "59000", the project will always use "<http://127.0.0.1:59000".> for the localhost URL. (Note that the named URL is more commonly used and for most purposes is better.) If this is not set the port will change from `ddev start` to `ddev start`                                                |
| host_db_port                     | localhost binding port for database server                                                | If specified here, the database port will remain consistent. This is useful for configuration of host-side database browsers. Note, though, that `ddev mysql`, `ddev psql`, and `ddev sequelpro` do all this automatically, as does the sample command `ddev mysqlworkbench`.                                                                                                                                                                |

## global_config.yaml Options

The $HOME/.ddev/global_config.yaml has a few key global config options.

| Item  | Description                                                                   | Notes  |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| nfs_mount_enabled | Enables NFS mounting globally for all projects                                | Only a "true" value has any effect. If true, NFS will be used on all projects, regardless of any settings in the individual projects. |
| mutagen_enabled | Enables Mutagen asynchronous caching globally for all projects                | If true, Mutagen will be used on all projects, and this overrides NFS mounting as it's incompatible with NFS. |
| table-style | Set the style for `ddev list` and `ddev describe`                             | Options are "default", "bold", and "bright". "bright" is a pleasant colored output that some people will like. |
| simple-formatting | If true, turns off most table formatting in `ddev list` and `ddev describe`   | This tries to give plain vanilla output for list and describe, and also suppresses colorized text everywhere. |
| fail_on_hook_fail | Enables `ddev start` interruption globally for all projects when a hook fails | Decide whether `ddev start` should be interrupted by a failing hook |
| omit_containers | Allows the project to not load specified containers                           | For example, `omit_containers: [ "dba", "ddev-ssh-agent"]`. Currently only these containers are supported. Note that you cannot omit the "db" container in the global configuration, but you can in the per-project .ddev/config.yaml. |
| web_environment | Set the DDEV-provided variables in the web container                          | For example, `web_environment: ["SOMEENV=someval", "SOMEOTHERENV=someotherval"]`.  |
| instrumentation_opt_in | Opt in or out of instrumentation reporting                                    | If true, anonymous usage information is sent to ddev via [segment](https://segment.com) |
| router_bind_all_interfaces | Bind on all network interfaces                                                | If true, ddev-router will bind on all network interfaces instead of just localhost, exposing ddev projects to your local network. If you set this to true, you may consider `omit_containers: ["dba"]` so that the phpMyAdmin port is not available.  |
| disable_http2 | Disable http/2 listen in ddev-router                                          | If true, nginx will not listen for http/2, but just use http/1.1 ssl. There are some browsers which don't work well with http/2. |
| internet_detection_timeout_ms | Internet detection timeout                                                    | ddev must detect whether the internet is working to determine whether to add hostnames to /etc/hosts. It uses a DNS query and times it out by default at 750ms. In rare cases you may need to increase this value if you have slow but working internet. See [FAQ](../faq.md) and [issue link](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/2409#issuecomment-662448025).|
| use_hardened_images | If true, use more secure 'hardened' images for an actual internet deployment  | The most important thing about hardened images is that sudo is not included in the web container, and the container is run without elevated privileges. This is generally used with experimental casual hosting feature. |
| use_letsencrypt | If true, enables experimental Let's Encrypt integration                       | 'ddev global --use-letsencrypt' or `ddev global --use-letsencrypt=false'. This requires letsencrypt_email to be set, and can't work if the system is not available on the internet. Used with experimental casual hosting feature. |
| letsencrypt_email | Email associated with Let's Encrypt for experimental Let's Encrypt feature    | Set with`ddev global --letsencrypt-email=me@example.com'. Used with experimental casual hosting feature.|
| developer_mode | Set developer mode                                                            | If true, developer_mode is set. This is not currently used. |
| required_docker_compose_version | Specify an alternate docker-compose version for download                      | If set to `v1.29.2`, for example, it will download and use that version instead of the expected version for docker-compose. |
| use_docker_compose_from_path | Use the system-installed docker-compose                                       | If this is true, then DDEV will use the docker-compose found in on your system's path instead of using its private known-good docker-compose version. |
| no_bind_mounts | Do not use docker bind mounts                                                 | Some docker environments (like remote docker) do not allow bind mounts, so this option turns off those and turns on mutagen and uses volume copies to do what bind mounts would otherwise do. |
