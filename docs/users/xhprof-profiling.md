## Profiling with xhprof

DDEV-Local has built-in [xhprof](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.xhprof.php) integration.

### Basic xhprof Usage (Using Browser Plugin)

You can enable xhprof support with `ddev xhprof enable` and see status with `ddev xhprof status`

For more information and a GUI-style review of xhprof results, see the in-progress PR at <https://github.com/drud/ddev-contrib/pull/128>.
