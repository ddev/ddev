## DDEV-Live Hosting Integration

DDEV provides a hosting solution, [DDEV-Live](http://dash.ddev.com/), as part of the full DDEV development and deployment platform. You can use DDEV-Live with DDEV-Local as you would use any hosting provider, by pushing code to Github, exporting databases to a file and then pushing them up, etc.

Visit the [documentation pages for DDEV-Live](https://docs.ddev.com/getting-started/) to get started with Drupal, TYPO3, or other PHP projects.
