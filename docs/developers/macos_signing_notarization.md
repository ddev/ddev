# macOS Signing and Notarization

We've had a number of issues and PRs related to macOS signing and notarization ([signing PR](https://github.com/drud/ddev/pull/1727), [signing issue](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/1626), [notarization PR](https://github.com/drud/ddev/pull/2015)), but because it's complex and somewhat poorly documented topic, this topic can be maintained to try to capture the concepts, flow, techniques, and rexources.

## Overview

Apple's ongoing initiatives at controlling what runs on their platforms took a new turn with macOS Catalina (10.15), with required app and command-line binary signing. They had threatened required notarization at the release of Catalina in November, but [delayed that to 3 Feb 2020](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12232019a&irgwc=1&aosid=p239&cid=aos-us-aff-ir&irchannel=13631&irpid=27795&clickid=xCbU172KJxyORV9wUx0Mo34BUknR3xW91R0sUY0&ircid=7613).

Notarization requires

* Signing the binary or app with a Developer ID Certificate (not just a distribution cert)
* Notarization (uploading the binary to Apple for approval)
* Validating code signing
* Validating notarization

## Signing a binary

* Signing requires the one-time task of obtaining a doing a certificate request (and creating associated private key), downloading the cert certificate. See [docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html).
* The *notarization* process requires that binaries be signed with a *Developer ID certificate*, so our accounts@drud.com account on developer.apple.com now has a cert called 'Developer ID Application: DRUD Technology, LLC (3BAN66AG5M)'. This can be used for more than just DDEV-Local (can be used for DDEV-Live, for example)
* Signing is done with the macOS tool codesign. For example,
`codesign --keychain buildagent -s 'Developer ID Application: DRUD Technology, LLC (3BAN66AG5M)' --timestamp --options runtime .gotmp/bin/darwin_amd64/ddev`
* The full signing action is done as a make target, `make darwin_signed`, which is implemented in the [Makefile](https://github.com/drud/ddev/blob/1a7e5539abf06cc2521d576b79c94315d27e349c/Makefile#L125-L136). Because the work has to be done in a CI process, it's associated with a privately injected environment variable, $DDEV_MACOS_SIGNING_PASSWORD, which is the local password of the exported certificate.

### Validating signature on the binary

Signature validation can be done with `codesign -v`, for example, `codesign -vv -d .gotmp/bin/darwin_amd64/ddev`.

## Notarizing a binary

Notarizing a binary means

* Uploading the signed binary to Apple for its approval
* Verifying that the process completes successfully and has no warnings
* Verifying from the build process (a link given at notarization completed) that there are no warnings. (When I first got notarization to work, it reported that the package was accepted, but there was a warning that it did not have a "Developer ID" certificate, and thus was *not* successful.)
* In the case of a .app or other types of artifact, "stapling" the approval to the artifact. In the case of a command-line binary it is not possible to staple the approval. [Apple announcement](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06032019i) specifies that stapling is for apps, installer packages, and kernel extensions. We can expect this to be added in the future for command-line binaries, but at this time there is no place in the binary architecture for anything to be stapled. The [Apple notarizing article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow#3087720) says
    > Although tickets are created for standalone binaries, itâ€™s not currently possible to staple tickets to them.

### Validating notarization

The best technique I've found for validating succesful notarization was [archichect](https://eclecticlight.co/2019/11/26/how-to-check-quarantine-64-bit-signature-and-notarization-for-almost-anything/), which validates the signing and also checks in with Apple to see if it's been notarized.

`codesign --test-requirement="=notarized" --verify --verbose ddev` was suggested as an approach, but it doesn't seem to work on a binary that can't be stapled.

## CI-based Signing and Notarization

Signing and Notarizing are implemented in the project [Makefile](https://github.com/drud/ddev/blob/1a7e5539abf06cc2521d576b79c94315d27e349c/Makefile#L125-L136).
The CircleCI release build does a `make darwin_notarized` (which has `darwin_signed` as a dependency).
