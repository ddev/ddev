<h1>Building, Testing, and Contributing</h1>

## Building

 ```
 make
 make linux
 make darwin
 make windows
 make test
 make clean
 ```

 Note that although this git repository contains submodules (in the containers/ directory) they are not used in a normal build, but rather by the nightly build. You can safely ignore the git submodules and the containers/ directory.

## Testing
Normal test invocation is just `make test`. Run a single test with an invocation like `go test -v -run TestDevAddSites ./pkg/...`

If you set the environment variable DRUD_DEBUG=true you can see what ddev commands are being executed in the tests.
