# Amazee Lagoon provider configuration.

# To use this configuration,

# 1. Check out the project and then configure it with `ddev config`. You'll want to use `ddev start` and make sure the basic functionality is working. Your project must have a .lagoon.yml properly configured.
# 2. Obtain and configure an SSH key at https://dashboard.amazeeio.cloud/settings
# 3. Add LAGOON_PROJECT and LAGOON_ENVIRONMENT variables to your project in `web_environment` or a `.ddev/.env`
# `ddev pull lagoon`
