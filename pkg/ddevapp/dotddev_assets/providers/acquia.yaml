#ddev-generated
# Acquia provider configuration.

# To use this configuration,

# 1. Get your Acquia API token from your Account Settings->API Tokens.
# 2. Make sure your ssh key is authorized on your Acquia account at Account Settings->SSH Keys
# 3. `ddev auth ssh` (this typically needs only be done once per ddev session, not every pull).
# 4. Add / update the web_environment section in ~/.ddev/global_config.yaml
#    or your project config.yamlwith the API keys:
#    ```yaml
#    web_environment:
#    - ACQUIA_API_KEY=xxxxxxxx
#    - ACQUIA_API_SECRET=xxxxx
#    ```
# 5. Add the ACQUIA_ENVIRONMENT_ID environment variable to your project config.yaml, for example:
#    ```yaml
#    web_environment:
#    - ACQUIA_ENVIRONMENT_ID=project1.dev
#   - On the Acquia Cloud Platform you can find this out by navigating to the environments page,
#     clicking on the header and look for the "SSH URL" line.
#     Eg. `project1.dev@cool-projects.acquia-sites.com` would have a project ID of `project1.dev`
# 6. `ddev restart`
# 7. Use `ddev pull acquia` to pull the project database and files.
# 8. Optionally use `ddev push acquia` to push local files and database to Acquia. Note that `ddev push` is a command that can potentially damage your production site, so this is not recommended.

# Debugging: Use `ddev exec acli command` and `ddev exec acli auth:login`

# Instead of setting the environment variables in configuration files, you can use
# `ddev pull acquia --environment=ACQUIA_ENVIRONMENT_ID=yourproject.dev` for example
