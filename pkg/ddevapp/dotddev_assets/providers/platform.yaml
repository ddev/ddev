#ddev-generated
# Upsun Fixed/Platform.sh provider configuration. This works out of the box, but can be edited or copied to add
# your own preferences. If you edit it, remove the `ddev-generated` line from the top so
# that it won't be overwritten.
#
# NOTE: Historically this recipe required you to set PLATFORM_PROJECT and PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT
# in your project environment. In most cases those values can be derived automatically:
# - PLATFORM_PROJECT: derived from .platform/local/project.yaml (id field)
# - PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT: derived from your current git branch
#
# You only need to explicitly set those environment variables (e.g. in .ddev/config.yaml,
# .ddev/config.<name>.yaml, or via `ddev config --web-environment-add=...`) when automatic
# derivation is not appropriate for your workflow or the files are not present.

# Consider using `ddev add-on get ddev/ddev-upsun` (https://github.com/ddev/ddev-upsun) for more
# complete Upsun Fixed integration.

# To use this configuration,

# 1. Check out the site and then configure it with `ddev config`. You'll want to use `ddev start` and make sure the basic functionality is working.
# 2. Obtain and configure an API token.
#    a. Login to the Upsun (Fixed) Dashboard and go to Account->API Tokens to create an API token for ddev to use.
#    b. Add the API token to the `web_environment` section in your global ddev configuration at ~/.ddev/global_config.yaml:
#    ```yaml
#    web_environment:
#        - PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=abcdeyourtoken
#    ```
#    You can also do this with `ddev config global --web-environment-add="PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=abcdeyourtoken"`.
#
#    To use multiple API tokens for different projects, add them to your per-project configuration
#    using the .ddev/config.local.yaml file instead. This file is gitignored by default.
#    ```yaml
#    web_environment:
#        - PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=abcdeyourtoken
#    ```
#
# 3. Optionally add PLATFORM_PROJECT, PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT,
#    and PLATFORM_APP ( if your environment contains more than one app) variables to your
#    project `.ddev/config.yaml` or a `.ddev/config.local.yaml`. You do not need to add these
#    if your branch is the same as your environment and the project is specified in .platform/local/project.yaml.
#    ```yaml
#    web_environment:
#        - PLATFORM_PROJECT=nf4amudfn23biyourproject
#        - PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT=main
#        - PLATFORM_APP=app
#    ```
#    You can also do this with `ddev config --web-environment-add="PLATFORM_PROJECT=nf4amudfn23biyourproject,PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT=main,PLATFORM_APP=app"`.
#
# 4. `ddev restart`
# 5. Run `ddev pull platform`. After you agree to the prompt, the current upstream database and files will be downloaded.
# 6. Optionally use `ddev push platform` to push local files and database to Upsun. Note that `ddev push` is a command that can potentially damage your production site, so use it against an environment you want to use it against.

# If you have more than one database on your Upsun Fixed project,
# you will likely to choose which one you want to use
# as the primary database ('db').
# Do this by setting PLATFORM_PRIMARY_RELATIONSHIP, for example, `ddev config --web-environment-add=PLATFORM_PRIMARY_RELATIONSHIP=main`
# or run `ddev pull platform` with the environment variable, for example
# `ddev pull platform -y --environment=PLATFORM_PRIMARY_RELATIONSHIP=main`
# If you need to change this `platform.yaml` recipe, you can change it to suit your needs, but remember to remove the "ddev-generated" line from the top.

# Debugging: Use `ddev exec platform` to use the `platform` CLI inside the web container to see what Upsun knows about
# your configuration and whether it's working correctly.
