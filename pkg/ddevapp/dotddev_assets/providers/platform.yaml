#ddev-generated
# Example Platform.sh provider configuration.

# Consider using `ddev get ddev/ddev-platformsh` (https://github.com/ddev/ddev-platformsh) for more
# complete platform integration.

# To use this configuration,

# 1. Check out the site from platform.sh and then configure it with `ddev config`. You'll want to use `ddev start` and make sure the basic functionality is working.
# 2. Obtain and configure an API token.
#    a. Login to the Platform.sh Dashboard and go to Account->API Tokens to create an API token for ddev to use.
#    b. Add the API token to the `web_environment` section in your global ddev configuration at ~/.ddev/global_config.yaml:
#    ```yaml
#    web_environment:
#    - PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=abcdeyourtoken
#    ```
# 3. Add PLATFORM_PROJECT and PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT variables to your project `.ddev/config.yaml` or a `.ddev/config.platform.yaml`
#    ```yaml
#    web_environment:
#    - PLATFORM_PROJECT=nf4amudfn23biyourproject
#    - PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT=main
# 4. `ddev restart`
# 5. Run `ddev pull platform`. After you agree to the prompt, the current upstream database and files will be downloaded.
# 6. Optionally use `ddev push platform` to push local files and database to platform.sh. Note that `ddev push` is a command that can potentially damage your production site, so this is not recommended.

# If you have more than one database on your Platform.sh project,
# you will likely to choose which one you want to use
# as the primary database ('db').
# Do this by setting PLATFORM_PRIMARY_RELATIONSHIP, for example, `ddev config --web-environment-add=PLATFORM_PRIMARY_RELATIONSHIP=main`
# or run `ddev pull platform` with the environment variable, for example
# `ddev pull platform -y --environment=PLATFORM_PRIMARY_RELATIONSHIP=main`
# If you need to change this `platform.yaml` recipe, you can change it to suit your needs, but remember to remove the "ddev-generated" line from the top.

# Debugging: Use `ddev exec platform` to see what platform.sh knows about
# your configuration and whether it's working correctly.
