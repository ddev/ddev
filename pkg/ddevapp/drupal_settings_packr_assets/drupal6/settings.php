/**
 * @file
 * Drupal site-specific configuration file.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * This file may have been set to read-only by the Drupal installation
 * program. If you make changes to this file, be sure to protect it again
 * after making your modifications. Failure to remove write permissions
 * to this file is a security risk.
 *
 * The configuration file to be loaded is based upon the rules below.
 *
 * The configuration directory will be discovered by stripping the
 * website's hostname from left to right and pathname from right to
 * left. The first configuration file found will be used and any
 * others will be ignored. If no other configuration file is found
 * then the default configuration file at 'sites/default' will be used.
 *
 * For example, for a fictitious site installed at
 * http://www.drupal.org/mysite/test/, the 'settings.php'
 * is searched in the following directories:
 *
 *  1. sites/www.drupal.org.mysite.test
 *  2. sites/drupal.org.mysite.test
 *  3. sites/org.mysite.test
 *
 *  4. sites/www.drupal.org.mysite
 *  5. sites/drupal.org.mysite
 *  6. sites/org.mysite
 *
 *  7. sites/www.drupal.org
 *  8. sites/drupal.org
 *  9. sites/org
 *
 * 10. sites/default
 *
 * If you are installing on a non-standard port number, prefix the
 * hostname with that number. For example,
 * http://www.drupal.org:8080/mysite/test/ could be loaded from
 * sites/8080.www.drupal.org.mysite.test/.

/**
 * Database settings:
 *
 * Note that the $db_url variable gets parsed using PHP's built-in
 * URL parser (i.e. using the "parse_url()" function) so make sure
 * not to confuse the parser. If your username, password
 * or database name contain characters used to delineate
 * $db_url parts, you can escape them via URI hex encodings:
 *
 *   : = %3a   / = %2f   @ = %40
 *   + = %2b   ( = %28   ) = %29
 *   ? = %3f   = = %3d   & = %26
 *
 * To specify multiple connections to be used in your site (i.e. for
 * complex custom modules) you can also specify an associative array
 * of $db_url variables with the 'default' element used until otherwise
 * requested.
 *
 * You can optionally set prefixes for some or all database table names
 * by using the $db_prefix setting. If a prefix is specified, the table
 * name will be prepended with its value. Be sure to use valid database
 * characters only, usually alphanumeric and underscore. If no prefixes
 * are desired, leave it as an empty string ''.
 *
 * To have all database names prefixed, set $db_prefix as a string:
 *
 *   $db_prefix = 'main_';
 *
 * To provide prefixes for specific tables, set $db_prefix as an array.
 * The array's keys are the table names and the values are the prefixes.
 * The 'default' element holds the prefix for any tables not specified
 * elsewhere in the array. Example:
 *
 *   $db_prefix = array(
 *     'default'   => 'main_',
 *     'users'     => 'shared_',
 *     'sessions'  => 'shared_',
 *     'role'      => 'shared_',
 *     'authmap'   => 'shared_',
 *   );
 *
 * Database URL format:
 *   $db_url = 'mysql://username:password@localhost/databasename';
 *   $db_url = 'mysqli://username:password@localhost/databasename';
 *   $db_url = 'pgsql://username:password@localhost/databasename';
 */

/**
 * Database default collation.
 *
 * All data stored in Drupal is in UTF-8. Certain databases, such as MySQL,
 * support different algorithms for comparing, indexing, and sorting characters;
 * a so called "collation". The default collation of a database normally works
 * for many use-cases, but depending on the language(s) of the stored data, it
 * may be necessary to use a different collation.
 * Important:
 * - Only set or change this value BEFORE installing Drupal, unless you know
 *   what you are doing.
 * - All database tables and columns should be in the same collation. Otherwise,
 *   string comparisons performed for table JOINs will be significantly slower.
 * - Especially when storing data in German or Russian on MySQL 5.1+, you want
 *   to use the 'utf8_unicode_ci' collation instead.
 *
 * @see http://drupal.org/node/772678

 * check. After finishing the upgrade, be sure to open this file again
