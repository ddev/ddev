 * To protect against these sort of attacks, Backdrop supports checking a list
 * of trusted hosts.
 *
 * To enable the trusted host protection, specify the allowable hosts below.
 * This should be an array of regular expression patterns representing the hosts
 * you would like to allow.
 *
 * For example, this will allow the site to only run from www.example.com:
 * @code
 * $settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = array(
 *   '^www\.example\.com$',
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you are running a site on multiple domain names, you should specify all of
 * the host patterns that are allowed by your site. For example, this will allow
 * the site to run off of all variants of example.com and example.org, with all
 * subdomains included:
 * @code
 * $settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = array(
 *   '^example\.com$',
 *   '^.+\.example\.com$',
 *   '^example\.org',
 *   '^.+\.example\.org',
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you do not need this functionality (such as in development environments or
 * if protection is at another layer), you can suppress the status report
 * warning by setting this value to FALSE:
 * @code
 * $settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = FALSE;
 * @endcode
 *
 * For more information about trusted host patterns, see the documentation at

/**
 * Reverse Proxy Configuration:

 * is behind a reverse proxy, the real IP address of the client should
 * be determined such that the correct client IP address is available
 * to Backdrop's logging and access management systems. In
 * the most simple scenario, the proxy server will add an
 * X-Forwarded-For header to the request that contains the client IP
 * address. However, HTTP headers are vulnerable to spoofing, where a
 * malicious client could bypass restrictions by setting the
 * X-Forwarded-For header directly. Therefore, Backdrop's proxy
 * configuration requires the IP addresses of all remote proxies to be
 * specified in $settings['reverse_proxy_addresses'] to work correctly.
 *
 * Enable this setting to get Backdrop to determine the client IP from
 * the X-Forwarded-For header (or $settings['reverse_proxy_header'] if set).
 * If you are unsure about this setting, do not have a reverse proxy,
 * or Backdrop operates in a shared hosting environment, this setting
 * should remain commented out.
 *
 * In order for this setting to be used you must specify every possible
 * reverse proxy IP address in $settings['reverse_proxy_addresses'].
 * If a complete list of reverse proxies is not available in your
 * environment (for example, if you use a CDN) you may set the
 * $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] variable directly in settings.php.
 * Be aware, however, that it is likely that this would allow IP
 * address spoofing unless more advanced precautions are taken.

 * cache without contacting the web server, if the user sends the same Cookie
 * header as the user who originally requested the cached page. Without "Vary:
 * Cookie", authenticated users would also be served the anonymous page from
 * the cache. If the site has mostly anonymous users except a few known
 * editors/administrators, the Vary header can be omitted. This allows for
 * better caching in HTTP proxies (including reverse proxies), i.e. even if
 * clients send different cookies, they still get content served from the cache.
 * However, authenticated users should access the site directly (i.e. not use an
 * HTTP proxy, and bypass the reverse proxy if one is used) in order to avoid

 * very large. It's possible to mitigate this by setting a shorter expiration
 * for cached forms. In some cases it may be desirable to set a longer cache
 * expiration. For example to prolong cache_form entries for Ajax forms in
