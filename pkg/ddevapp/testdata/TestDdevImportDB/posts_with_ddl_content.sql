Unfortunately, we’re still hearing stories about new hires taking as much 1-2 days to get their laptops properly set up and 1-2 weeks of onboarding before they can deliver code to production. In today’s competitive, fast-paced world, the amount of wasted time is untenable at best. The faster a team can deliver code to production, the better. However, you can’t cut corners without causing quality and efficiency to suffer. In this article, we’ll take a look at the process of onboarding new developers and discuss how the right development tools, like <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-local/\">DDEV-Local</a>, can help.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Why is it important to streamline developer onboarding?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you\'ve just made a bet on a talented, promising new hire, of course you don’t want to risk them making expensive mistakes. But why waste their time and your bottom line by not getting them up-and-running as fast and as well as possible? In the 2018 StackOverflow Developer Survey, more than 50,000 software developers from around the world answered the question, “<a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#work-how-long-do-developers-expect-new-coworkers-to-take-to-be-productive\">How Long Do Developers Expect New Coworkers to Take to Be Productive?</a>” 70% answered that it would take one month or more. We aimed to help speed that up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Update: While the <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#work-onboarding\">2020 StackOverflow survey</a> does not have the same question, it does ask if an onboarding process exists. The chart is a bit ambiguous but suffice to say half of the respondents were unsatisfied with the lack of onboarding process, or lack of good onboarding process, at their company.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3207} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://ddev.com/content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-7.17.40-PM-1024x466.png\" alt=\"Half of respondents reported having an onboarding process, one fifth reported no on boarding process\" class=\"wp-image-3207\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Five years ago, we had a constant problem when a new person came on at my old agency. A new hire would come in and everyone was running around too busy to help, but the new person still couldn\'t access, download, and set up the site they were tasked to work on. Instead of getting to it, they were effectively told, \"Here, wait until someone is available, and sit on your thumbs.\" How demoralizing! Particularly for high achievers who want to jump in and make a big impact out of the gates. Fortunately, we knew we were on the right track with the tools we built as early versions of DDEV-Local. We got onboarding down to a where we had new developers and designers contributing their first commit to production by lunchtime on their first day. This was the benefit of having consistency in our teams and our onboarding process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s why it’s so important to onboard new developers consistently and systematically. By giving them the information they need about workflows, tools, and projects, they can quickly adapt to how things are done at your agency. It\'s not just a time savings. It\'s how much more efficient you can be with a consistent process. This becomes even more important as the organization grows and independent teams need to start forming, causing processes to drift apart to the point where teams are unable to effectively working together.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In turn, consistency leads to a faster “time-to-productivity” for new team members and contractors alike, which in turn, ties to concepts of motivation and autonomy that Daniel Pink describes in his book<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us\"> Drive</a>. “The first week on the job is always going to be stressful for new team members, but enabling them to make a contribution early on helps them feel they are moving towards the Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose that Pink talks about in his book,” explains my colleague Kevin Bridges, DDEV CTO.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, this is all great in theory. But how can you make sure your onboarding process is thorough, comprehensive, and provides your new devs with everything they need to get started?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Some onboarding challenges</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One challenge of developer onboarding is assumed knowledge. Current team members already have a lot of knowledge about current projects and systems gained over their time in your organization. It can be hard for them to have the perspective distinguish between what’s essential what’s need-to-know (or nice-to-know) for new hires. How to communicate what and when in and around this knowledge gap can add to the stress during onboarding. Worse, if there are many different ways of doing something (even as simple as setting up and configuring a laptop with a local environment), you can find yourself in a situation where new hires can only receive support from the person that onboarded them versus the broader organization.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You’ll need to help prioritize this information, get your developers familiar with the basics first – and to let them start making contributions on their own. In this article about<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/02/05/secret-behind-great-developer-onboarding/\"> The Secret Behind Great Developer Onboarding</a>, two Runtastic employees suggest “Write code, learn about the company, and get to know your colleagues”, including using a buddy system, pairing new devs with someone who knows the ropes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Faster doesn’t always equal better. Care should be taken not to rush the onboarding process or cut corners. A junior developer’s<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/\"> Reddit CS Career Questions post</a> is a great illustration of this. This junior employee was given incorrect information about how to set up their development environment and ended up wiping the entire production database. While this is an extreme case, this is the sort of thing you’ll face if you don’t have systematic, consistent onboarding procedures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Codementor.io posted a great follow-up post in reaction to this Reddit post:<a href=\"https://www.codementor.io/blog/developer-onboarding-process-32y3zqg1vc\"> 7 Best Practices for Your Developer Onboarding Process</a>. The<a href=\"https://github.com/92bondstreet/awesome-onboarding\"> Awesome Onboarding project</a> on GitHub has more valuable resources in this vein.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Consistency is key to onboarding and delivery quality</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maintaining consistent development environments across different projects helps make developer onboarding faster and your teams more efficient. Whether you’re talking about working on client projects, or collaborating on open source projects, for newcomers - <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/xxx/removing-the-biggest-barrier-to-contribution/\">the biggest barrier to contribution is getting a local development environment set up</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As the team grew in the agency, so did the number of ways to configure and set up local development environments. This stifled collaboration. Whether or not you could work on a project depended on who had onboarded you to their idiosyncratic methods. We knew we couldn’t scale and improve if we didn’t have a consistent process. That was a major motivating factor in building the tools that became DDEV.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now you can use DDEV-Local to work on all your projects, no matter what open source CMS and deployment models you are using. Once you know a few simple commands, you can spin up any project on your local machine and get to work. And once you are familiar with it, you can apply your knowledge to projects across the board, easily sharing and spinning up projects from any existing configuration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Improve developer onboarding with DDEV-Local</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are two ways that DDEV-Local helps get your team members on board:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Consistency across platforms</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>DDEV-Local offers a single, consistent set of commands when working on projects, across multiple CMSs and across all the major operating systems, no matter what deployment model a project requires. Clients with multi-site portfolios may run Drupal sites, WordPress sites, or even Node.js applications and keep everything running smoothly. DDEV-Local provides a cross-platform PHP-based development environment that works the same on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Update: In our latest <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases/tag/v1.15.3\">DDEV-Local release, v1.15.3</a>, hundreds of tools, including Node.js, npm, Yarn, Drush, WP-CLI, and mysql are pre-installed in the web container. This means you can use DDEV-Local across your on-going projects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By having a consistent approach you make it easier for team members to reuse what they learn for their first project, and apply it to the next.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Take the guesswork out of getting started</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Previously, I wrote about<a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/workflow/the-practicality-of-project-reference-guides/\"> Project Reference Guides</a> to show how a simple-to-maintain resource can effectively improve communication and handoffs between teams. One of those challenges is keeping track of the credential and dependencies for any particular client project, as well as the tools required to get client sites built and running locally so you can get to work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When a team member wants to start collaborating they’ll need to <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#importing-assets-for-an-existing-project\">import assets for an existing project</a>. The first time they set it up, they can run <code>ddev describe</code> to see details about the status of the project and in-depth application monitoring. This also provides the project credentials they need to get started.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extending-commands/\">Extend ddev Commands</a> to run tasks, for example before or after a project starts. To automate setup tasks specific to your project, define them in the project\'s config.yaml file. This can make it easier for your team to employ best practices and greatly reduced the time it takes to scaffold a project.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Get started with DDEV-Local</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With DDEV-Local, you can speed up developer onboarding dramatically, while ensuring that new developers have all of the information they need to be effective.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#intro-to-ddev-local\">Get started with DDEV-Local</a> today and see how easy and reliable a local development environment can be.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><small>Photo credit hagman23 Pixabay <br>Originally published May 17, 2018</small></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Reduce the Time to Onboard New Developers with DDEV','','publish','open','open','','reduce-time-onboard-new-developers-ddev','','https://www.ddev.com/workflow/the-practicality-of-project-reference-guides/\nhttps://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/ddev-local-release-v0-18-0-easier-xdebug-windows-installer-and-more/','2020-10-15 18:33:05','2020-10-16 00:33:05','',0,'https://www.ddev.com/?p=1305',0,'post','',0),(2038,16,'2019-01-15 04:00:37','2019-01-15 11:00:37','We\'re sponsoring and attending Drupal Camp Florida 15-17 February, 2019!

This is a minor release with a couple of very useful features. <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases\">Install or upgrade now</a>. Here are a couple highlights:\r\n\r\n<strong>Added Linuxbrew for DDEV installation</strong> - <a href=\"http://linuxbrew.sh/\">Linuxbrew</a> is now our <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#homebrewlinuxbrew-macoslinux\">preferred install/upgrade technique on all Linux distributions</a>. This makes installation easy and upgrades even easier. We would have loved to support every Linux package manager but the more sustainable solution is this one manager-fits-all. <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/homebrew-ddev/pull/31\">“Fixes issue #1”</a>!\r\n\r\n<strong>Added php-apcu to the web container</strong> - php-apcu makes Composer classloading much faster. Drupal 8 and TYPO3 will see nice performance improvements, especially on the first visit to a project after a <code>ddev start</code>. For Drupal 8 <code>$settings[\'class_loader_auto_detect\'] = FALSE;</code> is added to the settings.ddev.php and it increases performance quite a lot with php-apcu. Thanks to Matt Glaman <a href=\"https://github.com/mglaman\">@mglaman</a> for the suggestion in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/54049172/215713\">Stack Overflow.</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Ghostscript in the web container</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.ghostscript.com/\">Ghostscript</a> is necessary for TYPO3 CMS to run with all its features. We’ve now added it as <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/920\">a standard component in DDEV</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Plus</strong>, we’ve added an upgrade to MariaDB in the database container, and PHP 7.3 now has <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/1350\">php-memcached in web container</a>.

I\'ve been working with Drupal for a little over six years, now. I first got into web development so that I could make a website for our Rainbow 6 clan, back in the good old days of MSN Zone and using Tripod UK so I could get free hosting that supported PHP.\r\n\r\nI joined Commerce Guys in 2015 after contributing to Drupal Commerce 1.x on a personal basis while working for two other Drupal-related businesses. I help co-maintain Commerce 2.x and a wide variety of contributed modules and work primarily with other agencies to help implement large Commerce 2.x projects successfully. I also remained a part of the core team at Commerce Guys when it split from Platform.sh to refocus on Drupal Commerce in 2016.\r\n<h3>You’ve written <a href=\"https://glamanate.com/tags/testing\">a three-part series about test-driven development</a> with Drupal. What was the big change with writing tests in Drupal 8?</h3>\r\nDrupal 8 adopted <a href=\"https://phpunit.de/\">PHPUnit</a> and deprecated Simpletest. This is probably one of my most favorite things about Drupal 8. Really. Writing tests for Drupal 7 was abhorrent and I like to work in a test-driven development mode.\r\n\r\nWith the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2304461\">KernelTestBaseTNG™</a> issue, Drupal core officially moved to being based on top of PHPUnit for Kernel and Unit tests. Soon more test types were to follow, such as <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2232861\">browser tests</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2469713\">JavaScript testing</a>.\r\n\r\nPHPUnit is the de facto xUnit implementation for PHP. That means Drupal tests are now written using the same testing infrastructure as Symfony and most other PHP projects. In fact, one of our earliest contributors for Drupal Commerce 2.x was new to Drupal but able to contribute code because they could easily write tests.\r\n<h3>That shows that when open source projects standardize, they make it easier for new contributors. What prompted you to write this series?</h3>\r\nA few years ago, I wrote <a href=\"https://drupalcommerce.org/blog/45322/commerce-2x-unit-kernel-and-functional-tests-oh-my\">a blog post for Drupal Commerce users</a> that helped explain the different test suites and how to run them—especially PhantomJS for the JavaScript tests. Recently, before writing the series, Drupal had finally dropped PhantomJS in favor of Chromedriver. After Chrome announced headless support, PhantomJS became antiquated as it was a headless WebKit browser. PhantomJS was also buggy and using Chrome via Chromedriver makes things must more stable.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is still hard for people to run tests locally, at least the JavaScript tests. This is especially true now that Nightwatch.js—a JavaScript testing framework which also runs Chromedriver—was added.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to write about how DDEV can make life easier.\r\n<h3>“Making life easier,” that’s what DDEV is aiming for! Tell us what you used for development before DDEV, and why you switched?</h3>\r\nBefore DDEV I managed my own tooling called <a href=\"https://github.com/mglaman/platform-docker\">platform-docker</a>. This was before Lando, Docksal, DDEV, and such. DrupalVM had just come out. I had been using Vagrant based tools but kept running out of disk space due to the sheer size of each VM required to meet client requirements. Then I found out about DDEV at Florida DrupalCamp 2018.\r\n\r\nI was glad I could finally drop my own blob of tooling and use a shared tool. I got sick of having to not only manage client sites but also manage my own tooling. I also stopped having to cycle through new projects. I would only have to spin up a new environment once every few months.\r\n\r\nI switched to DDEV so that I could just contribute to a tool and have what goodies I liked and take in goodies from others. We have also made DDEV our official local stack tool at Commerce Guys. It has allowed us to streamline local environments without any issues. We have projects set up for testing and Blackfire.io so everyone can do performance profiling.\r\n<h3>Thanks, Matt!</h3>\r\nThanks for all your contributions, Matt. It’s great that you’re investing the effort you used to put into your own tools into DDEV and helping so many other people. You sharing your knowledge with the community is making a big difference to a lot of developers.\r\n<h3>Learn more ...</h3>\r\nMatt Glaman wrote the <a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/drupal-8-development-cookbook-second-edition\">Drupal 8 Development Cookbook</a>, which includes 60 hands-on recipes that get you acquainted with Drupal 8.

We\'d love to have you try it, but it does require just a little bit of configuration on the host side.\n\nIn the above chart are some quick performance comparisons. Here you see times for a Drupal 8 install with traditional Docker mounting, NFS mounting, and webcache. The bottom line is NFS mounting is about 3 times as fast as traditional Docker mounting!\n\nOK, let\'s get started. On macOS, you need to do three basic things:\n<ol>\n 	<li>Give \"Full Disk Access\" to the terminal app you\'re going to use (on macOS Mojave and later). For example, if using iTerm2, you would go to Mac preferences -&gt; Security and Privacy -&gt; Privacy and click on \"Full Disk Access\" at the bottom of the list and then use the \"+\" to add iTerm2. This is demonstrated in the screencast below.</li>\n 	<li>Configure NFS on your machine. The simplest way to do this is by running the script <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drud/ddev/master/scripts/macos_ddev_nfs_setup.sh\">we provide for this purpose</a>. But it\'s your machine, so you can configure it manually or however you like, as long as the directory where you have your projects is shared. The script adds /Users to /etc/exports and then enables and start the nfsd daemon. After it\'s done, run <code>showmount -e</code> and you should see it exporting your /Users directory.</li>\n 	<li>Test and make sure it\'s all working! To do this, go to a project and just <code>ddev debug nfsmount</code> to see if it\'s working or not.

He really drove home the point that it doesn’t matter as much what tools you use as it does how you take care of the people involved so they can do their best work. Takeaways included balanced planning to avoid burnout, team morale checks, and mapping out your goals and the steps to get to them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://drupal.tv/external-video/2019-02-16/achieve-devops-nirvana-putting-one-foot-front-other\">check out the entire session here</a> on Drupal.tv</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2121} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.ddev.com/content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_20190216_111142-1024x689.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin presenting at Drupal Camp Florida.

So I sat down with him to find out about the course, his students, and how DDEV helps. It’s great to see students working with professional tools to learn industry-relevant skills.\r\n\r\nFor more updates from the DDEV community, join our mailing list.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"btn btn-outline-primary-light btn-lg d-block d-md-inline-block mb-1 ml-md-3\" href=\"http://eepurl.com/dlqkUD\">Join Newsletter</a>\r\n\r\nOliver Hader lives in Bavaria, Germany. “Fifty percent of the time I work for <a href=\"https://typo3.com\">TYPO3 GmbH</a> as a core developer, doing research and development. I keep up with new developments and see how we can include and support them in TYPO3. I also took over being the Security Team Lead at the beginning of this year. The other fifty percent of my time, I\'m self-employed, working for web agencies with JavaScript development and frameworks like Angular or Polymer. I also do some consulting in software architecture on how to build flexible applications that are scalable on cloud services. So my work is a mix between consulting and development.”\r\n\r\nOliver is motivated by his own experience as a student, even considering his busy schedule. “The teaching is another 10% on top of my schedule, which means a lot of preparation and feedback happens at the weekends. So this is 105%-110%. :) I think it\'s a good thing to pass on knowledge that you’ve collected, especially to let others know how they can improve make use of new technologies. I realized from my previous time of being a student, we felt ‘If we had known that earlier, it would have helped us a lot.’”\r\n\r\nHe brings his professional experience and aims to create a collaborative atmosphere in the course. “I don’t treat students as students, I try to treat them as new colleagues in a company.”\r\n<h3>Helping students gain professional skills</h3>\r\n“My students are part of a Masters program called Software Engineering and Industrial Applications.” Students come to take this course from all over the world, from North America, the Indian Subcontinent, and Africa. They all have bachelor degrees, but they don’t need to be computer science majors. “Some did electronic engineering, so web development and how it works is new to them. Others have worked with WordPress or other CMSs before. So it’s interesting to see how they interact with each other.”\r\n\r\nOliver teaches the course during the winter semester. The module includes 45 hours of in-classroom contact time and 105 hours of self-directed project work. The contact time is divided between lectures in the morning and hands-on practical instruction in the lab in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThey work on projects around content management, which fits well with their overall degree goals of learning software design principles. “They have to think in containers, packages, and reusable components. And a content management system qualifies quite well for that because you also find these patterns in a CMS.”\r\n\r\nSince the coursework is project-based, there’s no final exam. For their grade, students complete a project and document their approach. “They write about what went wrong and what went well, design patterns, and their initial plan of what they wanted to achieve.”\r\n\r\nIn the process, they create extensions, build websites and applications. That’s how they’re assessed. “If they created cool software, that\'s a good thing. If the application is complex enough, that\'s a good thing ... It\'s really focused on practical work, and not just learning for one exam and forgetting everything.”\r\n\r\n“I get them to work as a team, in groups of 4-5 people, rather than taking a teacher/student approach. When I get feedback from students, they tell me they like this practical approach, especially the aspects of collaboration. They learn how to work together.”\r\n\r\n“I appreciate that because it\'s what I wanted to achieve. I don\'t want to treat students as students but as my colleagues. I want to help them be successful with the project and the challenge they have to solve.”\r\n<h3>Consistent web development environments help teachers</h3>\r\nBefore DDEV came along, Oliver tried to find a reliable solution to help students set up a local development environment. When he first tried plain Docker there were known issues with Windows, which meant it wasn’t working well. So he set up VirtualBox for his students to use. It promised a consistent environment. “That\'s something I really wanted to have: that all the plugins packages and software that is installed are the same. For example, this would include the proper PHP version, PHP &amp; web server modules, virtual host configuration, ImageMagick, Node.js, and so forth.”\r\n\r\n“The sad thing is, whenever I made a mistake (and I make a lot of mistakes!) such as forgetting to configure packages, forgetting to figure out if image generation or PDF is working, it was difficult to make improvements and distribute them. I had to distribute a 4GB file on a USB stick.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed like there had to be a better way to do it. “DDEV eases the pain of using Docker,” though the students were struggling with limited hardware resources. Considering that, Oliver said, “It’s easier now to use DDEV, it works well for the TYPO3 environment.”\r\n\r\nThe biggest advantage comes from using containers. “That’s something I really wanted to have,” consistent environments means it’s easier to troubleshoot. “All the software and plugins are the same for everyone. If someone has an error we’re talking about the same environment.”\r\n\r\n“Using DDEV it\'s pretty easy to use a full blown web application. Everything that\'s required is defined in that DDEV container. And I can continue evaluating their projects.” For teachers looking at how to ease the pain of <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/removing-the-biggest-barrier-to-contribution/\">setting local development environments for newcomers</a>, that is really great to hear.\r\n\r\n“The good thing about using DDEV is that the students can share their projects very easily. They have the .ddev configuration file and they are using PHP Composer where they can define the package states of the extensions. This means, whenever there\'s a problem or they have a question on their application, I can check out that repository, and give them feedback to solve the problem.”\r\n<h3>Using open source - the software and the community</h3>\r\nThe students are getting a taste of what it’s like to work in open source, but it’s still a challenge. “I realized my students were really shy. They would try and solve problems on their own. I had to remind them that there\'s an open source community behind what they are using. There\'s a TYPO3 OSS community. You can ask the community. You can make use of any extensions available.”\r\n\r\nGiving students industry-standard professional tools and exposing them to open source communities is a win-win for employability and skills that will set them up for life.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear stories about how you’re using DDEV.

Our goal is to support our users in as much of your work as we can, and that also means supporting many older projects.\r\n\r\nAlthough the <a href=\"http://drupal.org\">Drupal</a> project officially discontinued all forms of support for Drupal 6 (D6) in February 2016 (six months after the release of Drupal 8), a couple of vendors signed up to continue support for D6 and they\'ve done an absolutely stupendous job, exceeding everyone\'s expectations. The original idea was that they\'d deal with security fixes only, mostly backporting issues found in current Drupal versions. But they also supported and made public quite a number of key modules.\r\n\r\nAnd then the big deal: PHP 5.6 went End-Of-Life at the end of December, 2018, meaning no more support for *it*. <em>And</em> PHP 5.6 was the highest version of PHP that D6 could run on. Amazingly though, one of the D6LTS maintainers, <a href=\"https://www.mydropwizard.com/drupal-6-lts\">myDropWizard</a>, came out with versions of D6 and many modules that are compatible with PHP 7.2. It\'s a game-changer that nobody expected, and was *not* a part of the original plan.\r\n\r\nHere\'s what I\'ve done to upgrade the Drupal 6 projects that I still maintain:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Check out the project.</li>\r\n 	<li>Download the latest d6lts/drupal [release] (<a href=\"https://github.com/d6lts/drupal/releases\">https://github.com/d6lts/drupal/releases</a>) or add it to your project with git.</li>\r\n 	<li>Overwrite your D6 core with the downloaded version.</li>\r\n 	<li><code>ddev config --php-version=7.2</code></li>\r\n 	<li><code>mkdir .ddev/php and add file there called mbstring.ini</code> (it can be called anything ending in .ini) with these contents:\r\n<code>mbstring.func_overload=0\r\nmbstring.encoding_translation=0\r\nmbstring.http_input=pass\r\nmbstring.http_output=pass&gt;/code&gt;</code></li>\r\n 	<li><code>ddev start</code></li>\r\n 	<li>Load your database and begin testing.</li>\r\n 	<li>You\'ll likely want to download key modules from <a href=\"https://github.com/d6lts\">https://github.com/d6lts</a> (use the \"Find a repository\" search box. But cck, panels, views are all there. I was able to find everything I needed for my smallish sites.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIf you\'re successful with your site (likely!) then you will have a D6 site that\'s supported at least until February 2020 by myDropWizard and the D6lts project, and PHP 7.2 is supported through November, 2020.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev\">DDEV</a> makes maintaining sites easy, just as in this case. You can have multiple CMSs, multiple PHP versions, and even both Apache and Nginx, all running at the same time on different sites, with basically no configuration. I found updating and testing these D6 sites to be a breeze.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, if I had known that D6 support would last this long and be of such high quality, it would have made a very significant difference in some decisions I made in 2015 and some things would have been much easier. Thanks to those D6LTS vendors for taking on the challenge and sticking with it, and especially to MyDropWizard for taking the challenge to an even higher level.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"btn btn-outline-primary-light btn-lg d-block d-md-inline-block mb-1 ml-md-3\" href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">Download DDEV-Local</a>','DDEV-Local, D6LTS, PHP 7.2, and Drupal 6 projects','','publish','closed','closed','','ddev-local-d6lts-php-7-2-and-drupal-6-projects','','','2019-03-28 22:34:50','2019-03-29 04:34:50','',0,'https://www.ddev.com/?p=2139',0,'post','',0),(2153,16,'2019-03-21 18:29:55','2019-03-22 00:29:55','Sign up for a two-hour course to learn how to use our open source local development environment <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">DDEV-Local</a> to streamline your web development workflow in Drupal Easy’s online course.\r\n\r\nApril 17, 2019 (1-3 pm EDT)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.drupaleasy.com/ddev\">Sign up here!</a>\r\n\r\nFind out <a href=\"https://www.drupaleasy.com/ddev\">what’s included, and the details about the course.</a>','DrupalEasy – Online Course April 2019','Sign up for a two-hour course to learn how to use our open source local development environment DDEV-Local to streamline your web development workflow in Drupal Easy’s online course.','publish','closed','closed','','drupaleasy-online-course-april-2019','','','2020-10-19 19:05:33','2020-10-20 01:05:33','',0,'https://www.ddev.com/?post_type=tribe_events&#038;p=2153',0,'tribe_events','',0),(2158,11,'2019-04-04 13:33:19','2019-04-04 19:33:19','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We\'re quite proud of the automated testing setup we use to develop&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev\">DDEV-Local</a>. Each pushed commit to the project gets a full set of tests run on macOS, Windows with Docker-for-Windows, Windows with Docker Toolbox, and Linux (Ubuntu).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Originally we tested quite nicely with just <a href=\"https://circleci.com\">CircleCI</a> (on Linux), and that did pretty well at finding issues with macOS. But when we started supporting Windows 10 Pro with Docker-for-Windows, and then Windows 10 Home with Docker Toolbox, we found that we really needed explicit coverage on those machines because there are a *lot* of behavior differences, so we implemented tests for each platform using <a href=\"https://buildkite.com\">Buildkite</a> and test machines that we maintain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though DDEV is written in <a href=\"https://golang.org/\">Go</a>, which is amazingly complete for each platform, things like filesystem case-sensitivity, slashes, and behavior of docker-compose cause plenty of unexpected issues. So we run more than 10 test suites on each push, building and testing the containers on Windows, Linux, and&nbsp; macOS, then a full application test suite on macOS, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Home, and Linux. And also with permutations for Apache support and the NFS mount feature. It\'s a lot of computing power but it\'s paid off enormously. All of this shows up very nicely on the DDEV-Local&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/pulls\">pull request</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/commits/master\">commits</a> pages, so it\'s easy to see at a glance what\'s happened with testing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our test suite is large and has grown over the lifespan of DDEV-Local, up to about 5500 lines of test code (out of the 14,680 lines of code that make up DDEV) that get run on every push.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest problems we have with this whole setup is it seems to push Docker to the limit, especially on Windows. So we see too often the Docker failures and hangs that users see only infrequently. Currently, this means a lot of random maintenance of Docker on the test machines. We recently found a way to make CircleCI\'s macOS support work with Docker and that\'s been a win, but it\'s a bit costly and may not work out in the end.&nbsp;Upcoming features of <a href=\"https://www.appveyor.com/\">Appveyor</a>, for continuous integration on&nbsp;Windows, will allow its use with Linux containers, which should help smooth out our process even further.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Try out DDEV-Local for yourself, and consider contributing to it as an open source project!

The 3-minute screencast below shows how installation and setup works on all 3 platforms.\r\n\r\n<strong>macOS</strong>: After installing DDEV-Local v1.8.0 and running <code>ddev stop --all</code>, run <code>mkcert -install</code> and provide your password at the sudo prompt.\r\n\r\n<strong>Linux</strong>: After installing DDEV-Local v1.8.0 and <code>ddev stop --all</code>, run <code>mkcert -install</code> and follow the instructions given. You\'ll likely have to install the libnss3-tools package (Debian/Ubuntu <code>apt-get install -y libnss3-tools</code>). Add /usr/sbin to your path, and <code>mkcert -install</code> again.\r\n\r\n<strong>Windows</strong>: After installing DDEV-Local v1.8.0 and <code>ddev stop --all</code>, run <code>mkcert -install</code> and accept the dialog that pops up.\r\n\r\nThis entire feature is made possible by the outstanding <a href=\"https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert\">mkcert</a> project, another major triumph of open-source and open-source collaboration.

Here are a couple of examples of how you might make these modifications, and a screencast with a walkthrough:\r\n\r\n<strong>Simple: Add webimage_extra_packages to config.yaml</strong>\r\n\r\nIf you need extra packages, just find out what they are (for Debian) and add them to your .ddev/config.yaml, like\r\n\r\n<code>webimage_extra_packages: [php-yaml]</code>\r\n\r\n(or use <code>ddev config --webimage-extra-packages=php-yaml</code>)\r\n\r\n<strong>Fancy and Unlimited: Build your own .ddev/web-build/Dockerfile</strong>\r\n\r\nFor people with a need for more complex changes, copy the .ddev/web-build/Dockerfile.example to .ddev/web-build/Dockerfile and hack at it. Note that a Dockerfile overrides any <code>webimage_extra_packages</code> you may have added, as you\'d want to take on all customization yourself. <code>ddev start</code> will remind you of this if you have both.\r\n\r\nThanks for your support for DDEV-Local, and we look forward to hearing what you do with these new capabilities.

This release includes trusted SSL, refreshed <code>ddev stop</code> behavior, and updated <code>ddev exec</code> functionality. <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases\">Install or upgrade now</a>. Below are a couple of highlights, or you can read the <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases/tag/v1.8.0\">full release notes here</a>.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Browsers and host OSs now trust ddev sites over https</strong>: After a one-time action to run <code>mkcert -install</code>, you can visit the https link to your project without needing to click past the security warning. <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#linux-mkcert-install-additional-instructions\">Extra details for Linux users here</a>. <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation\">More info in the install instructions here</a>.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Dynamic container updates</strong>: If you need extra Debian packages in your web or db container (or need to make more sophisticated adjustments) you no longer have to wait for them, or install them every time you start a project. You can add <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/customizing-images/#adding-extra-debian-packages-with-webimage_extra_packages-and-dbimage_extra_packages\">webimage_extra_packages</a> to your config.yaml or <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/customizing-images/#adding-extra-dockerfiles-for-webimage-and-dbimage\">build a free-form Dockerfile</a> (Dockerfile.example is provided in your .ddev folder).</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Updates to <code>ddev stop</code></strong>: <code>ddev stop</code> now does what <code>ddev remove</code> used to do. It removes the containers and saves resources on your host. <code>ddev remove</code> is still available as an alias of <code>ddev stop</code>. New! <code>ddev pause</code> takes the place of the former <code>ddev stop</code> using \"docker stop\" on the project containers. Because of the way ddev works (storing everything outside the container) it\'s cleaner to get rid of a container and recreate it when starting a project.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>ddev exec and exec hooks now interpret commands using bash</strong>: This means you can have a hook like <code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y [some-package]</code> without putting <code>bash -c</code> in front of it. And you can <code>ddev exec sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade -y [some-package]</code> as well, no <code>bash -c</code> required.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>ddev exec can now work with interactive situations</strong>: So for example, you can run  <code>ddev exec mysql</code> and interact with the mysql program directly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Important notes:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>The base nginx configuration has changed. If you are overriding configuration with an nginx-site.conf file, you\'ll want to re-do it (much easier now!). In addition, small pieces of nginx configuration can now be added in the .ddev/nginx directory. See the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/customization-extendibility/#providing-custom-nginx-configuration\">docs</a> for more information.</li>\r\n 	<li>config.yaml exec hooks are now executed with bash context by default. If you have exec hooks that have <code>bash -c</code> in them, please remove that, as they can\'t be interpreted correctly by the new execution mechanism. If using custom nginx configuration update your nginx config as well.</li>\r\n 	<li>If you or your team used to use <code>ddev stop</code> instead of <code>ddev remove</code>, the new behavior of \"stop\" may seem different, but it hopefully won\'t affect most people. However, if you have an add-on docker-compose.*.yaml service that has volatile storage, you may want to change it to save its database on a volume, as <code>ddev stop</code> now completely brings down the containers, and if they had volatile content, it will be gone.</li>\r\n 	<li>If you use drush in exec hooks, and the action you take requires confirmation, please change the exec hook to use <code>drush --yes</code>. Formerly, --yes was implied by exec hooks and <code>ddev exec</code>, but it isn\'t any more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<a class=\"btn btn-outline-primary-light btn-lg d-block d-md-inline-block mb-1 ml-md-3\" href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases/tag/v1.8.0\">Read the full release notes &amp; installation info</a>\r\n<h2>Contributing to DDEV-Local</h2>\r\nThank you very much to all the DDEV community members who helped out with this release!\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><a href=\"https://github.com/damienmckenna\">@damienmckenna</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/wizonesolutions\">@wizonesolutions</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/mglaman\">@mglaman</a> among others worked to significantly improve the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/additional-services/#apache-solr\">Apache Solr docs</a> and example docker-compose.solr.yaml, and added a docker volume so the solr database would be nonvolatile after ddev stop.</li>\r\n 	<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AronNovak\">@AronNovak</a> created the PR to have the ddev-webserver nginx configuration not intercept 40x errors.</li>\r\n 	<li><a href=\"https://github.com/yanniboi\">@yanniboi</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/isholgueras\">@isholgueras</a> were kind enough to catch and PR docs errors.</li>\r\n 	<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dacostafilipe\">@dacostafilipe</a> introduced a PR adding pgsql libraries</li>\r\n 	<li>@jonaseverle and <a href=\"https://github.com/hebbet\">@hebbet</a> helped test the release</li>\r\n 	<li>And the amazing <a href=\"https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert\">mkcert</a> from <a href=\"https://github.com/FiloSottile\">@FiloSottile</a> made the seemingly impossible task of trusted local development certificates possible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">DDEV is an open source project</a> and we very much appreciate the time our contributors give creating issues, surfacing bugs, requesting features, supporting other users in <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#support\">Slack</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ddev\">Twitter</a> and for your support of DDEV!\r\n<h2>DDEV-Live Hosting Updates</h2>\r\nWe recently gathered our hosting team for a week of time together pushing ahead on development. Not only did we progress on existing tasks and clarify the roadmap for everyone, but we had time to really connect and make decisions in face-to-face conversations. Being able to have those discussions in person meant that we could review options, considerations, and come to an agreement three to five times faster than when working remotely.\r\n\r\nSome technical highlights we had a lot of movement on were global user management, the details of how the UI, CLI and platform interact, building Kubernetes controllers for various functions, and planning ahead so that we can stay in sync and balanced while continuing to work remotely.\r\n\r\nWe’ve also been doing more work as pairs to encourage frequent conversation, questioning, and combining our individual knowledge and ideas earlier in the process. It’s the varied backgrounds and perspectives of everyone on the DDEV team that really create strength when combined, so we’re eager to give everyone’s ideas a chance to surface naturally and frequently. We’re very grateful that it was possible for us to bring everyone together and look forward to the next group gathering!\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2216 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.ddev.com/content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_0160-300x245.jpg\" alt=\"Boulder Startup Week DevTools panel\" width=\"300\" height=\"245\" />\r\n<h2>DDEV Events</h2>\r\nThis week we visited <a href=\"https://boulderstartupweek2019.sched.com/event/NNY7/so-you-want-to-launch-a-devtool\">Boulder Startup Week and talked about DevTools</a>!

We’ve been working hard to use the native features of Kubernetes to build our hosting platform, <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live</a>, and we’re invested in contributing back to Kubernetes itself to strengthen and extend functionality for everyone. I asked our DDEV team members who attended for some highlights and a little background to introduce themselves. Meet Jason, Nic, and Jan!\r\n<h3>Jason:</h3>\r\n<strong>Could you tell us a little about yourself and your approach to your work?</strong>\r\n\r\nI’m a native Texan, frequent traveler, based in San Antonio. I’m passionate about bringing cloud native practices like observability, self healing and repeatability to the enterprise world. My philosophy is that if you can write down the process of operating a software system on paper in plain english, you can describe it in code!\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your role with DDEV and how to does Kubernetes figure into that?</strong>\r\n\r\nI joined the DDEV team in January 2018 as a Cloud Architect for DDEV-Live. My initial focus was to implement a process for managing Kubernetes clusters in AWS, along with a full monitoring stack, networking and storage add-ons.\r\n\r\nI later became more involved in the software development side of DDEV-Live, and eventually took on the role of engineering lead. Since then, I realized that our existing implementation of the platform had gotten us far, but we wanted to add several fundamental architectural features to meet the needs of our community.\r\n\r\nKubernetes at its core is not really just about container orchestration, but a set of design principles. A declarative API, which uses abstract vocabulary to describe computing concepts, combined with an event driven, eventually consistent controller pattern is why Kubernetes won the container orchestrator war. DDEV-Live is a platform which does not focus on hacking together older tools in an effort to force them to work in a cloud native environment, but rather implementing Kube-native APIs to describe the process of operating PHP Sites. As Kubernetes matures, we are able to learn and develop DDEV-Live along with it, so that now we are effectively extending Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is your history with Kubernetes and KubeCon?</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is my third KubeCon and my first time to attend it in Europe. I got introduced to Kubernetes for the first time at <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/45281\">OSCON back in 2015 at the 1.0 launch in Portland</a>. I could already see its potential as the revolution we had needed in managing cloud technology. I have been using Kubernetes now for over 2 years to orchestrate containers in production.\r\n\r\nOver the last 6 months, my focus has shifted more from using Kubernetes to extending Kubernetes. Some of my contributions so far have been to Kube Ecosystem projects such as <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/\">AlertManager</a> and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/\">NGINX Ingress Controller</a>. I am looking to get further involved with the Kubernetes SIGs, which are special interest groups who focus on certain topic areas of the platform such as Instrumentation and MultiCluster.\r\n\r\nWe’ve also had a lot of interest for the new <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/sig-drupal\">Drupal/Kubernetes SIG</a>, where we’re starting to collaborate on creating reusable patterns that will support everyone working with Kubernetes in the Drupal community. It’s been interesting to hear how others are approaching similar problems to what we’ve seen and to combine our efforts to help builders get started more quickly in the future.\r\n\r\n<strong>What sessions at KubeCon really struck your interest?<img class=\"alignright wp-image-2237\" src=\"https://www.ddev.com/content/uploads/2019/05/KubeCon-Nic-Jason-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Nic and Jason at KubeCon\" width=\"467\" height=\"350\" /></strong>\r\n\r\nMo Khan gave a really good deep dive session into the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2xcNjKLU9E&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PpmMAnvpvsnR4c27wJePh3&amp;index=249&amp;t=0s\">inner workings of the Kube-API</a>, focusing on how authentication and authorization works, and how it could be extended. This is an area I have already been developing in and I am grateful to have gotten the chance to talk to Mo and other contributors about this rather obscure area of Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nJason DeTiberus and Hardik Dodiya gave a great presentation over the architecture and goals of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mtg8jygK3Hs&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PpmMAnvpvsnR4c27wJePh3&amp;index=291&amp;t=0s\">Cluster and Machine APIs</a>. These APIs are key to being able to use a Kube control plane to manage Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes to manage Kubernetes? Pretty cool right? The development of APIs like this further a prediction that I share with others that the control plane pattern of Kubernetes will live on long after containers are replaced by something else.\r\n\r\n<strong>What else about the event would you like to highlight?</strong>\r\n\r\nThis KubeCon was really unique for me in that it reinforced how diverse and powerful the cloud native community really is, and that this is a global effort. There were far more tracks that were oriented towards contributors looking to extend Kubernetes, rather than it overly being an avenue for vendors to showcase their Kubernetes products, talk about service meshes or running stateful sets.\r\n\r\nI was able to connect directly with several Kubernetes SIGs that I am planning to be more involved with, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-api-machinery\">api-machinery</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle\">cluster lifecycle</a> in particular. The maintainers in these SIGs are always looking for help, so I have several issues in the apiserver-builder and controller-runtime that I plan to work on and offer pull requests for this summer.\r\n<h3>Nic:</h3>\r\n<strong>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</strong>\r\n\r\nHi, my name is Nic and I originally joined the DDEV team as an intern while I finished the last semester of my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio (I actually graduated the day before heading to KubeCon!). I aspire to grow into a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and/or Platform Architect in the Cloud/Kubernetes space. I’m always hungry for knowledge, and my coworkers can definitely confirm that I ask a massive amount of questions on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n<strong>What’s your role with DDEV and how does Kubernetes figure into that?</strong>\r\n\r\nI am currently a Software Developer, having joined DDEV in December 2018. I work with my fellow hosting team engineers to build the next iteration of our Kubernetes-native hosting platform: DDEV-Live. Kubernetes and its ecosystem is where I do my day-to-day work, and have had the opportunity to be exposed to, learn, and develop in a wide slew of different areas within this ecosystem. These areas include platform API and Operator development, monitoring, logging, CI/CD, and testing.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is your history with  Kubernetes and KubeCon?</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is my second Kubecon. I previously went to Kubecon Austin in December 2017 where I got my first true exposure to Kubernetes and the cloud-native community. Since then, I can’t begin to describe how much I’ve learned about Kubernetes. My latest big project outside of my work on DDEV-Live was an automated Kubernetes microservice testing project I had to develop as a research assistant for a Ph.D research project during my last semester of college. During this time I was also working with DDEV full time, and was able to directly apply what I learned at work to this research-oriented work.\r\n\r\n<strong><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2238\" src=\"https://www.ddev.com/content/uploads/2019/05/KubeCon-Nic-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Nic at KubeCon\" width=\"383\" height=\"510\" /></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>What sessions at KubeCon really struck your interest?</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8swjziYjY8&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PpmMAnvpvsnR4c27wJePh3&amp;index=117&amp;t=0s\">Scavenging for Reusable Code in the Kubernetes Codebase - Kevin Lingerfelt</a>\r\n\r\nIt was insightful to get a practical example of something that I have been doing since day one with DDEV, so learning a few tips and tricks throughout this talk only improved my ability to find and implement new and exciting ideas and concepts.\r\n\r\n<a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6VPBUIkgqo&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PpmMAnvpvsnR4c27wJePh3&amp;index=296&amp;t=0s\">How to Create Kubernetes Experts - Clarke Vennerbeck &amp; Aaron Teague</a>\r\n\r\nAs a newcomer to the professional world of I.T. and I.S. this talk relayed to me a few key points that I should keep in the back of my mind during my journey along this road.\r\n\r\n<strong>What else about the event would you like to highlight?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt was honestly surprising to see the amount of progress in the Kubernetes ecosystem compared to the last Kubecon I attended in December 2017. It seems now that the shift in industry use of Kubernetes has gone from working within the pre-defined boundaries of core Kubernetes to now creating custom extensions of Kubernetes concepts like custom API servers, and custom resource definitions (CRDs), along with the controllers and operators that are used to define and execute the logic for these custom resources.\r\n\r\nWe on the DDEV team have already started this journey as we built this iteration of DDEV-Live, so to be able to expand my existing knowledge through going to these talks was an invaluable experience. To add to this, talking to vendors in the vendor hall also gave me advantageous insight into the present state of the Kubernetes and Cloud Native business landscape.\r\n<h3>Jan:</h3>\r\n<strong>Please tell us a bit about yourself and your role with DDEV.</strong>\r\n\r\nI am yet another engineer trying to automate repetitive and mundane operations tasks, breaking as few things as possible along the way. I’m a Site Reliability Engineer, and so I spend my time writing, deploying and breaking Kubernetes operators.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is your history with Kubernetes or KubeCon?</strong>\r\n\r\nI have contributed to both <a href=\"https://github.com/wozniakjan\">Kubernetes and OpenShift</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>What sessions at KubeCon really struck your interest?</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCXiXKMqnuE&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PpmMAnvpvsnR4c27wJePh3&amp;index=96&amp;t=0s\">The Kubernetes Control Plane for Busy People Who Like Pictures - Daniel Smith</a>\r\n\r\nInspiring insight into how people at Google design their Kubernetes controllers and operators, and how they split really complicated problems into simpler sub-problems.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sDTB4eV4F8&amp;list=PLj6h78yzYM2PpmMAnvpvsnR4c27wJePh3&amp;index=31&amp;t=0s\">Kubernetes Failure Stories and How to Crash Your Clusters - Henning Jacobs</a>\r\n\r\nFailure stories and most importantly how to recover and plan for preventing those are always very valuable. It’s also pleasant to hear and reassuring that other people break things too.\r\n\r\n<strong>Any final Kubernetes thoughts?</strong>\r\n\r\nKubernetes growth is unprecedented. This software really helps with sore spots probably every modern company has been dealing with. It’s been remarkable being along for this ride!\r\n<h3>Thank you KubeCon!</h3>\r\nOpen source engagement in the communities around the software we use is central to our mission with DDEV. KubeCon was a really good opportunity to hear from others and have conversations about how we can work together to continue extending Kubernetes and the projects we build with it.

Recent versions of <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">DDEV-Local (v1.10+)</a> add custom commands and loads of other goodies we\'d like to show you how to use. In this screencast and tutorial, we\'ll show you how to make use of DDEV-Local custom commands, adding webserver packages, and adding extras in .ddev/homeadditions to support your specific project needs.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt, update DDEV-Local on your machine and run <code>ddev config</code> on a project before getting started with new features.\r\n\r\nAs an example, and since there are many folks who absolutely love <a href=\"https://www.zsh.org/\">zsh</a> and <a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh/\">oh-my-zsh</a> (an alternative Unix shell and an accompanying framework), we\'ll demonstrate these features by showing you how to add zsh and oh-my-zsh to a DDEV project. We\'re going to do three things to demonstrate this:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Add the zsh Debian package into the web container with <code>webimage_extra_packages</code></li>\r\n 	<li>Add a custom command that works just like <code>ddev ssh</code>, but it\'s going to be <code>ddev zsh</code></li>\r\n 	<li>Add all the scaffolding for oh-my-zsh in the home directory for lovers of oh-my-zsh</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWatch the video below and read the detailed instructions to configure your own project:\r\n\r\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyhzszuF9Rg&feature=youtu.be&hd=1[/embed]\r\n<h5>How to add zsh and oh-my-zsh to DDEV-Local:</h5>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>From the root of an existing project configured with DDEV-Local: Add the zsh package to the webserver container by adding <code>webimage_extra_packages: [\"zsh\"]</code> to the .ddev/config.yaml (or run <code>ddev config --webimage-extra-packages=zsh</code>, which does the exact same thing). If you only want zsh in the web container, you can <code>ddev restart</code> and you\'re done!</li>\r\n 	<li>To add a <code>ddev zsh</code> custom command to your project, place a file named \"zsh\' in .ddev/commands/web/zsh with the following contents and make it executable with <code>chmod +x zsh</code>:\r\n<pre>#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n## Description: ssh into web container using zsh\r\n## Usage: zsh [flags] [args]\r\n## Example: \"ddev zsh\"\r\n\r\nzsh $@</pre>\r\nNow you can run <code>ddev zsh</code> and be in your familiar zsh environment (if you did the <code>ddev restart</code> after adding the package in step 1) .</li>\r\n 	<li>If zsh is all you want, copy your favorite .zshrc into .ddev/homeadditions for your project and zsh will be set up with your .zshrc every time you start the project. You\'re done now.</li>\r\n 	<li>Now to add all the goodies that make <a href=\"https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh\">oh-my-zsh</a> work:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>If you already have a ~/.oh-my-zsh and ~/.zshrc, you probably can just copy those into .ddev/homeadditions and they will be added on every <code>ddev start</code>.</li>\r\n 	<li>Otherwise, create the .oh-my-zsh like this:</li>\r\n 	<li><code>cd .ddev/homeadditions</code></li>\r\n 	<li>`curl -Lo <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"http://install.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-token-index=\"1\" data-reactroot=\"\">install.sh</a> <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem;\" href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-token-index=\"3\" data-reactroot=\"\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh`</a></li>\r\n 	<li><code>ZSH=./.oh-my-zsh sh ./install.sh --unattended</code></li>\r\n 	<li><code>cp ~/.zshrc .</code> (This copies the .zshrc that install.sh will have mistakenly put in your home directory.</li>\r\n 	<li>Change the line near the top of the .ddev/homeadditions/.zshrc to `export ZSH=~/.oh-my-zsh` instead of what the oh-my-zsh installer generated.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n 	<li>Now you can run <code>ddev start</code> and <code>ddev zsh</code> will have all the oh-my-zsh goodies.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>To review,</strong> we used three advanced features of ddev:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Added an extra Debian package (zsh) with webimage_extra_packages (<a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/customizing-images/#adding-extra-debian-packages-with-webimage_extra_packages-and-dbimage_extra_packages\">docs</a>)</li>\r\n 	<li>Added a custom command (zsh) in .ddev/commands/web by adding a simple script (<a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/custom-commands/\">docs</a>)</li>\r\n 	<li>Added extra stuff (oh-my-zsh and .zshrc) into .ddev/homeadditions that will be added to the home directory in the web container on every <code>ddev start</code> (<a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/in-container-configuration/\">docs</a>).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHappy customizing!

A couple things you asked about:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>The DDEV-Local <code>ddev share</code> command - this command is for temporarily sharing a project on your local machine via the web. While we will have a more typical preview functionality on the DDEV-Live platform, <code>ddev share</code> is meant only for giving your mom or client a quick look at work in progress.

The best part of these sessions is so often the Q&amp;A, and folks were eager to get into the specifics of how operators work. We invited anyone who is interested to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/sig-cms\">join a Kubernetes special interest group (SIG)</a> that focuses on how we can build and define standards for operators, controllers, and other resources across CMS communities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Info and slides: <a href=\"https://t3dd19.typo3.com/program/sessions/kubernetes-x-typo3\">Kubernetes x TYPO3</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2318} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.ddev.com/content/uploads/2019/08/Image-from-iOS-2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"DDEV-Live demo\" class=\"wp-image-2318\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>DDEV-Live, Live!</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also demoed deploying a TYPO3 site to our hosting platform, DDEV-Live, for the very first time.

We are strong believers in continuing the culture of collaboration and mentorship in everything we do to support you in your own work. <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live</a> is a growing platform, and it needs your input to help us deliver what you need. Here’s some of what we’ve done so far thanks to feedback from the Drupal community:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Documentation: helping you help yourself</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For a completely new platform like DDEV-Live, it’s necessary that we do some extra explaining around new processes, terms, and commands. Our early access users are a particularly curious and ambitious bunch who voraciously consumed both the getting started guides and command line help, really exploring the extent of the platform’s capabilities. Everyone helped to identify documentation gaps, steps to clarify, and some areas where we determined that changing the overall command structure would be the most effective solution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The system aims to be as friendly, logical, and straightforward as possible so that when you log in you can use commands in a way that feels familiar. There’s a lot of functionality available in the back-end of the platform that we are exposing via the Command Line Interface (CLI), so you’ll see more updates as those features are released to users. For example, additional commands or scripts in the remote environment, such as Drush for Drupal, are available via `ddev-live exec`, much like in DDEV-Local. While we’re building out user-facing documentation, many of these answers and pointers can be found in the FAQ section of the dashboard once you sign up.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The process for getting started is a bit different from what you may be used to, and includes installing a GitHub App as well as the DDEV-Live CLI. We designed DDEV-Live to be accessed via our CLI tool in order to bring platform functionality directly to developers before fully developing a graphical user interface. One early access user mentioned that CLI-first design is a big plus for developers who want a direct connection to the platform without hunting for the newest button.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For macOS users, we’re very pleased to have added the DDEV-Live CLI to Homebrew, so setup is much easier and requires fewer steps (one step!). Package manager support will come soon for Linux and Windows users, as well. This eliminates the need to adjust your $PATH variable and other terminal settings, making the process more universal and simple.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Additionally, we first gave options for setting some defaults when you got started, but this turned out to be confusing for users who weren’t familiar with some of the terminology. In order to reduce the amount of repetitive typing required to get your work done on the platform, we introduced setting your “default org” as a first step. That makes it easy for you to reference when running commands, and for all of us in subsequent documentation steps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Pushing your project to DDEV-Live</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We changed how the platform handles assets – both database and files – &nbsp;when uploading a new project as well as when executing backups and regular syncing to work locally. To make this easier on you, we restructured the logic of asset push and pull to mimic the `mv` command you are likely familiar with. As a result, you can move your assets precisely where you want them according to your usual workflows, rather than working with the platform’s assumptions based on your project type (so far we’ve primarily been testing with Drupal users).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Currently, DDEV-Live offers manual backups of your data. Users were quick to request automated backups in the trial as well, so the ability to set or unset automation is coming in the next CLI release. Your data is critically important, and with this additional functionality you can control your data backups to meet your needs or your client’s needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Flexibility is another key feature of DDEV-Live, and it will manifest in a wide variety of ways. Integration with other version control systems like GitLab and Bitbucket was frequently mentioned in user feedback and is in our roadmap. GitHub is the first option because it is the most commonly used and offered a quick way to get started.&nbsp;We designed DDEV to work well with CI/CD integration, which has struck the interest of several larger agencies who could especially benefit from this level of flexibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Early access users have also been interested in the installability of the platform. Giving you the ability to control the exact location (i.e., cloud, in-house hardware, etc.) of your data is a central part of our mission. <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/contact/\">Please get in touch with us</a> if this is something you or your organization are interested in so we can work together to set our roadmap priorities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Coming soon</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’ve been adding in additional support for TYPO3 CMS projects and have successfully launched several internally, as well as working with a TYPO3 expert to define additional needs before sending a release to <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/using-ddev-to-teach-open-source-web-development/\">the very enthusiastic TYPO3 community</a>. Thank you all especially for your eagerness to start using DDEV-Live; we’re committed to bringing you the reliable and robust experience you’ve come to expect from DDEV.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Several early access users mentioned functionality they’re familiar with in DDEV-Local, namely being able to set configuration and then take that configuration to another instance, or in this case, to DDEV-Live. For example, more fine-grained control over PHP versions is in the roadmap for the next round of feature updates.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another wishlist item was for an interactive command line similar to `ddev config` for DDEV-Local, which walks a user through several set-up steps to set or confirm basic configuration. This early access user said, “[an interactive command line] is less scary for my junior devs,” which is exactly what we’re aiming for – simplicity and approachability so that everyone can get the benefits of modern infrastructure without being cloud architects.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Real, live, cloud-hosting with DDEV</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For these early access customers DDEV-Live is not hosting production sites. However, we did launch our first employee site into production and I’m pleased to announce that <a href=\"https://randyfay.com\">randyfay</a><a href=\"https://randyfay.com/ddev-live\">.com</a> is the first live website on DDEV-Live!

Those are generally faster than searching the docs any time.</span></li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><code>ddev launch</code></strong> is pretty nifty. It works on most platforms, and opens a web browser to the current project. You can also add a URI, like <code>ddev launch /admin/reports/status/php</code></span></li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><code>ddev snapshot</code></strong> does a very fast save of your database. I like to use it with a name, for example <code>ddev snapshot --name=before_phase2_upgrade</code> so that I can remember what in the world it was about (and use <code>ddev restore-snapshot before_phase2_upgrade</code> to restore it). Otherwise it just gets a date/timestamp (</span><a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#snapshotting-and-restoring-a-database\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">docs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).</span></li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><code>ddev mysql</code></strong> launches the mysql client in the db container and lets you interact with it, so you can do anything you might usually do with mysql. And you don\'t need to have the mysql client installed on your local machine. I mostly use the interactive mode, but also with <code>ddev mysql -uroot -proot</code> to use root privileges, or <code>echo \"SHOW TABLES;\" | ddev mysql</code></span></li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><code>ddev share</code></strong> is a wonderful way to show off your work to a collaborator or client. You just need</span><a href=\"https://ngrok.com/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ngrok</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (even without a login, even without a paid account) and you can <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/sharing-a-ddev-local-project-with-other-collaborators/\">look at your project together</a> with somebody else anywhere in the world.</span></li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>HTTPS</strong>: Are you getting the most out of DDEV-Local\'s HTTPS support? It was the most popular feature of 2019 in our</span><a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/vote-for-your-favorite-new-ddev-local-development-environment-features/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent survey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about favorite features. Run <code>ddev poweroff &amp;&amp; mkcert -install</code> and you\'ll have trusted local https URLs in most browsers (and the HTTP urls still work fine too).</span></li>\n 	<li><strong>NFS</strong>: If you\'re on macOS or Windows and not yet using NFS to mount files into the container, you\'ll find it provides better performance by quite a bit, and also provides more consistent server-like behavior than Docker mounts do on macOS or Windows. See the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/performance/\">docs</a>.</li>\n 	<li><strong>Custom Commands</strong> are amazingly easy to create. Does your team have a workflow that isn\'t built into DDEV-Local? Add a <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/custom-commands/\">custom command </a>- it\'s just a simple shell script. The <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev-contrib\">ddev-contrib</a> repository has a number of <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev-contrib#custom-command-examples\">custom command examples</a> as well.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Updating</strong>: Are you updating DDEV-Local the easy way?

Using xip.io and or your own name resolution and open up to the local network</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second solution is to <em>not</em> use *.ddev.site as your project URLs, but to use DNS that you control (and that points to the host machine where your project lives). In general you\'ll want to use http URLs with this approach, because it requires manual configuration of the client machine to get it to trust the development certificate that ddev uses (and configures with mkcert on the local machine).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Use <a href=\"http://xip.io/\">xip.io</a> to point a domain name to your host.  If your computer\'s IP address is 192.168.5.101, you can use a domain name like mysite.192.168.5.101.xip.io and that domain name will point to your computer. Now add that as an additional_fqdn to your project, <code>ddev config --additional-fqdns=mysite.192.168.5.101.xip.io</code> and <code>ddev start</code>. Now people in your internal network should be able to <code>ping mysite.192.168.5.101.xip.io</code> if your firewall allows it. (Note that if you have other convenient ways to create a DNS entry for this, you can use those instead of using xip.io.)</li><li>Configure ~/.ddev/global_config.yaml to bind to all ports:<code> ddev config global --router-bind-all-interfaces &amp;&amp; ddev poweroff &amp;&amp; ddev start</code></li><li>Now mobile apps or other computers which are on your <em>local</em> network should be able to access your project. Use the http URL rather than the https URL because computers outside yours don\'t know how to trust the developer TLS certificate you\'re using. (You can use <code>ddev describe</code> to see the http URL, but it\'s typically the same as the https URL, but with \"http\" instead of \"https\".)</li><li>Make sure your firewall allows access from your local network to the main interface you\'re using. In the example here you should be able to ping 192.168.5.101 and <code>curl [&lt;http://192.168.5.101&gt;](&lt;http://192.168.5.101&gt;)</code> and get an answer in each case.</li><li>If you\'re using WordPress or Magento 2 you\'ll need to change the base URL as described in the <code>ddev share</code> instructions above.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>3.

This makes starting and installing a new project a breeze, and is a fantastic time-saver for many users. People can follow one of the many DDEV-Local <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#quickstart-guides\">Quickstart Guides</a> and have a project up and installed in no time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To make this happen, DDEV-Local does a quite a bit of settings management for explicitly supported CMSs. DDEV will:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Create a main settings file if none exists (like Drupal or Backdrop\'s settings.php).</li><li>Create a specialty config file with DDEV-specific settings (like AdditionalSettings.php for TYPO3 or settings.ddev.php for Drupal).</li><li>Add an include of the specialty file if needed (like adding settings.ddev.php include to the bottom of settings.php for Drupal.</li><li>Create additional common configs as needed (like drush.yml for Drupal).</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This really helps new users and people who are kicking the tires on a CMS. Plus it\'s helpful for many developers in their regular workflow. However, there are plenty of you who have sophisticated team and project workflows and don\'t want DDEV-Local to manage settings files, or prefer to manage your own. DDEV has always tried to give you control as needed:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>If you don\'t want DDEV to touch a file, remove the <code>#ddev-generated</code> line from that file, empty it or put your own contents in it, and check it into version control. DDEV will then ignore that file and not try to regenerate it.</li><li>If you don\'t want DDEV to even know what kind of CMS (or other project) you have, just use <code>type: php</code> in your .ddev/config.yaml (or run <code>ddev config --project-type=php</code>). DDEV will no longer create or tweak any settings files, you\'re now on your own (The one drawback of this approach is that you don\'t get the nginx configuration which has been tweaked for your CMS. But, as always, you can create your own nginx or apache configurations.) (<a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/customization-extendibility/\">docs</a>).</li><li>In DDEV-Local <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases\">v1.13</a> we added a community-requested feature, <code>disable_settings_management: true</code>. If you want DDEV to use the CMS-specific nginx configuration, but don\'t want it to touch anything else, you can put <code>disable_settings_management: true</code> in your .ddev/config.yaml (or run <code>ddev config --disable-settings-management</code>) and DDEV won\'t try to create any of the CMS-specific settings files.</li><li>In v1.13+ there is also an environment variable <code>$IS_DDEV_PROJECT</code> that can be used to fence off DDEV-specific behavior. For example, with <code>$IS_DDEV_PROJECT</code> empty, the important parts of settings.ddev.php and AdditionalSettings.php (for TYPO3) are not executed.&nbsp; This means that DDEV\'s settings.ddev.php won\'t be invoked if it somehow ends up in a production environment or in a non-DDEV local development environment.</li><li>The .ddev/.gitignore is created by <code>ddev start</code> because it gitignores itself. So the intention is that you can <em>not</em> check in the .ddev/.gitignore and it will be created on start <em>if</em> disable_settings_management is false. This helps teams to share .ddev folder checked in by git, even if the .ddev/.gitignore changes with different versions.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Is DDEV-Local currently missing explicit support for your CMS?

It works great, mostly because it runs pure Debian Linux in what it calls the \"Terminal\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here\'s the step-by-step to set up a DDEV-Local development environment:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>In Settings→Linux (Beta) \"Turn on\" Linux.</li><li>In Linux, create a password for the username you\'ve created, <code>sudo passwd $USER</code></li><li>Install Docker for Linux as in the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/docker_installation/#linux-installation-docker-ce\">ddev docs</a>. You\'ll be installing the <em>Debian</em> version (<a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/\">link</a>).</li><li>Install Linuxbrew with (<code style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 16px;\">/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"</code></li><li>Install ddev and docker-compose: <code>brew tap drud/ddev &amp;&amp; brew install ddev docker-compose</code></li><li>Add your user to the \"docker\" group with <code>sudo usermod -aG docker $USER</code></li><li>Reboot the Debian container with <code>sudo reboot</code> and then open \"Terminal\" again. You should be able to <code>docker ps</code> successfully.</li><li>Allow ddev to bind to all interfaces: <code>ddev config global --router-bind-all-interfaces</code></li><li>To use a browser to visit your site, you have two options. The first is to just install a browser like Firefox or Chromium inside Linux and use the built-in X11 capabilities to use that browser.  The second is to use Chrome\'s browser; that has some problems especially with https, as described below.<ul><li>To install a browser, <code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y chromium-browser</code>.  You\'ll also want to run <code>mkcert -install</code>. Then use the browser inside Linux.</li><li>To use the built-in Chrome browser:<ul><li>Find out the IP address of your Debian terminal with <code>ip -a | grep eth0</code>. You\'ll see something like \"inet 100.105.93.95/28 brd 100.115.92.207\" and the \"100.115.92.195\" is what you\'re after.</li><li>Install a Chrome extension like Host Switch Plus and configure it (Edit 2020-10-14: Host Switch Plus is no longer available, but <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livehosts/hdpoplemgeaioijkmoebnnjcilfjnjdi\">Livehosts</a> may offer the same capability). Unfortunately the Chrome browser doesn\'t innately understand how to connect to the webserver running in the Debian terminal system, so we\'ll use Host Switch Plus to convert \"*.ddev.site\" to connect to 100.115.92.195 (in my case).

And it\'s nicely integrated, including default X11 support (GUI Linux apps \"just work\" and display with no effort). It has two USB-C ports (fantastic) but also a USB-A (unlike Apple!)</li><li>I have to confess I\'d probably buy a more powerful Chromebook, with more RAM and storage, if I were going to work with this for the long term; perhaps I\'d get a Pixelbook.</li><li>Mostly there\'s nothing fiddly to do. You just have a great Linux computer that works with the nice ChromeOS desktop, and the Linux is pretty much natural, standard, no hoops to jump through.</li><li>I ran into some apps that I was unsatisfied with. Slack and<a href=\"http://notion.so\"> Notion.so</a> didn\'t work well as Android apps (too slow on this computer, which also doesn\'t have a touchscreen, so not that much of a fit for Android apps.</li><li>There were some apps that I couldn\'t use at all unless I ran them in Linux. They ran fine, but Linux GUI apps just aren\'t as well-tuned as those on other platforms. I had to run PHPStorm in Linux, and Firefox or Chrome if I wanted to use https.</li><li>Of course I didn\'t have the versatility of the Mac or the predictability and wide app support of Windows. But if I were doing only web development and normal editing/daily work stuff it might just work out.</li><li>Installing PHPStorm and other Jetbrains applications on the Linux side was not very hard: <ul><li><code>sudo apt-get install libnss3</code></li><li>Download<a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/\"> Jetbrains Toolbox for Linux</a> and install and run it, then use it to fetch and install PHPStorm. </li></ul></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since we\'re in the era of Linux laptops with Chromebooks and WSL2, we\'ll soon be doing a full writeup on how to use DDEV-Local with WSL2.

CI/CD embodies continual, incremental changes, updates, and deployments to a particular deliverable such as a website. We assume no project is ever \'done,\' but instead in a state of constant improvement. And these small, incremental changes are faster, easier, and more reliable to deliver, making your developers much more effective.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can put this into practice with many different tools, and developers all have their favorites. The exact setup you choose can depend on project and client requirements, as well as personal preference, and can consist of various combinations of \"point\" solutions that each solve one part of the puzzle. Your teams probably already have their favorites, such as Jenkins, CircleCI, and Travis. Ready to get started? Here is a step-by-step guide for teams to integrate one standard tool, <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/jenkins/\">Jenkins, with DDEV-Live</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:block {\"ref\":2710} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"benefits\">The Benefits of CI/CD</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Deploy Faster More Often.</strong> Testing, merging, and deploying your work in small steps is much less risky than massive deployments. Every CI/CD solution promises this risk reduction. What’s unique about DDEV-Live’s approach is that you don’t have to switch existing tools or workflows for deploying applications. The deployment process begins when code is checked into your code repository (GitHub, Gitlab). DDEV-Live then works in concert with popular CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, CircleCI or Travis creating a way to ship safely, many times a day if necessary.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Improve your bottom line. </strong>\"If you could save just one hour per day, per developer, on a team of twenty, that\'s like getting a half-time dev more working for you for the same price,\" Steve explains. \"CI/CD can make a fixed number of dollars much more efficient, productive, and less prone to error. Not doing it—not enabling your teams with these proven tools and processes—is ignoring some low hanging fruit for cost savings. It doesn\'t make sense to me.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Free your teams to work more effectively. </strong>And it\'s not only developers who are freed to concentrate on their work when operations take a back seat. Steve says, \"A web designer or front-end engineer can do more of what gets them up in the morning, which for many people isn\'t operations. That way, they\'re also delivering the most value.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shared responsibility versus single-point-of-failure. </strong>If you\'re still not too excited about CI/CD, DDEV-Live Cloud Technical Architect, Jason Roberts, has a scenario that will make you sit up and listen. \"If the engineer who performs your deployments suddenly leaves the company (or goes on vacation, extended sick leave, or gets married), could your organization continue to perform deployments and releases of new sites or features? How long would it take for you to get back up to speed?\" With CI/CD, the deployment process is automated, therefore more reliable and owned by the organization, rather than just a few individuals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How DDEV-Live Fits In</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We build the DDEV platform to fit our clients’ processes and tooling, not the other way around.

It integrates into your workflows and supports the tools and systems you already use. From the DDEV-Local development environment to hosting with DDEV-Live, our tools are there to accommodate your requirements, not the other way around.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This flexibility applies to CI/CD processes, too: we support integration with many popular tools. If you\'re setting out on your CI/CD journey, you can be sure your chosen path won\'t clash with your hosting setup if you decide to integrate DDEV-Live. Because of the flexibility offered by our system, if you have existing workflows your team can set up integrations with the tools that are already working for them. This reduces their learning curve to near-zero, saving time and money. Future iterations can be rapid, smooth, and predictable, with clear and known costs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Your CI/CD Journey</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>CI/CD, like DevOps and other modern development practices, is all about minimizing risk by taking small steps, while \"banking\" the gains by automating more and more of what you learn over time. This philosophy applies to establishing your CI/CD processes, too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Steve has some tips for starting out or expanding your existing setup: \"Concentrate on one part of the process first, such as deploying changes you make locally to a test site where others can see it. Then repeat and refine the steps it takes to make it happen.\" Sorting through the many tools available for CI/CD purposes can be a challenge. For this, he recommends seeking recommendations from other engineers you trust and sticking to the open-source principles that have made DDEV and what we do possible. \"Search for open source tools with lots of users that recommend them,\" he says.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Start small in the beginning and experiment with different tools. Use monitoring and reporting results to get better and better over time. Every developer hour you save through automation and improved reliability is an hour that your teams can put into delivering more value.

Because most of the tools and platforms we use will run in many different operating systems and environments, we have the option of rolling our own, using a commercial project like <a href=\"https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/mac/\">MAMP</a> or <a href=\"https://localwp.com/\">Local</a> (for WordPress), or using one of the many Docker-based solutions like <a href=\"http://ddev.readthedocs.io\">DDEV-Local</a>, <a href=\"https://docksal.io/\">Docksal</a>, or <a href=\"https://lando.dev/\">Lando</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>But what\'s so special about DDEV-Local</strong>? What makes it different from other Docker-based solutions like <a href=\"https://lando.dev/\">Lando</a> or <a href=\"https://docksal.io/\">Docksal</a>? I recently spent a little time exploring several similar platforms to research a <a href=\"https://ddev.com/event/drupalcon-global-2020/\">presentation for DrupalCon Global</a>, and was impressed with what I saw, but definitely came away wanting to highlight a number of DDEV-Local features. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Top technical features of DDEV-Local</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Full cross-platform support on Windows, Linux, and macOS</strong>: We support and test DDEV-Local on <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#system-requirements\">macOS, Windows 10 Home, Pro, and Linux.</a> Windows is a first-class citizen, both on the traditional Windows side and the new and exciting <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/ddev-wsl2-getting-started/\">WSL2 feature</a>.</li><li><strong>Interoperability with many versions of Docker</strong>: While a number of tools require you to use one exact version of Docker (and may take the liberty of installing it themselves), DDEV-Local currently works fine with versions that are a couple of years old, and is always attempting to keep up with the bleeding edge as well.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong>: We think DDEV-Local on macOS and Windows has about the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/performance/#performance\">best performance</a> you can get on a Docker-based platform, both in terms of starting ddev (around 20 seconds) and in terms of webserving. With a few seconds of setup the NFS mounting feature speeds up webserving by probably 3x.</li><li><strong>Settings file management</strong>: DDEV is happy to get you started quickly and easily and even manage your settings files. You can use your own repository or follow one of the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#quickstart-guides\">quickstart guides</a> to create something new and you\'ll have a project going in no time. You can also <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-local/controlling-cms-settings-files-in-ddev-local/\">turn off settings file management</a> to fine tune your team\'s approach when you need more customization.</li><li><strong>Trusted HTTPS</strong>: DDEV uses <a href=\"https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert\">mkcert</a> to allow you to conduct all your work using <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-local/ddev-local-trusted-https-certificates/\">locally trusted HTTPS</a>, just like it will work in the real world. You don\'t have to click around scary browser warnings to view your project in development.</li><li><strong>Database snapshots</strong>: DDEV-Local has the <code style=\"font-size: 16px;\">ddev snapshot</code> feature, which allows you to quickly capture the state of your <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/ddev-local-database-management/\">database</a> and then quickly restore to a different point. You can name snapshots for different branches of your project. It\'s far faster than traditional export and import.</li><li><strong>Golang deployment environment</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev\">DDEV-Local</a> is written in <a href=\"https://golang.org/\">Go</a>, a newer language. This is a bit of a disadvantage in terms of community involvement but it\'s a huge advantage for cross-platform support. Golang does cross-platform builds with ease, and the resulting fat binary has no dependencies at all (except Docker of course). There are no libraries to install, not DLLs to maintain, etc.</li><li><strong>Xdebug step-debugging out of the box</strong>: Lots of people have their first experience with a <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/step-debugging/#step-debugging-with-ddev-and-xdebug\">real step-debugging environment</a> for the first time with DDEV-Local because it\'s really, really easy. With PHPStorm, there\'s no setup at all. With VSCode, it\'s about 2 minutes of setup, and it \"just works.\" There\'s no need for inserting print statements into code any more.</li><li><strong>Explicit support</strong> for a growing number of CMSs and platforms: TYPO3, Drupal, Wordpress, Magento, Magento2, Laravel, and Backdrop. Explicit support means settings management and an NGINX configuration customized for the specific platform.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Plays well with others</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>No vendor lock-in</strong>: There is absolutely no vendor lock-in in DDEV-Local. The idea behind the DDEV platform is that both DDEV-Local and <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live</a> can be plugged into a dev-to-deploy workflow as pieces of a puzzle that work <em>for you</em>. Mix and match! The full DDEV platform offers extra benefits from the complete <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/providers/DDEV-Live/\">integration</a>, but DDEV-Local is a community project that works great with any hosting service you can use, and DDEV-Live works with any local development environment. </li><li><strong>Respect for other tools and production environments</strong>: DDEV\'s settings files aren\'t used when they\'re not being used in a DDEV context, so your project won\'t accidentally have DDEV-Local settings if you deploy them accidentally to production, and if you have the same project set up for Lando <em>and</em> DDEV the DDEV settings won\'t break Lando.</li><li><strong>Respect for your host computer</strong>: DDEV-Local does <em>not</em> assume that you use your computer (or Docker) only for its sake. A number of local dev tools will happily reconfigure your host computer without your full involvement. More than one of them will edit your /etc/exports file, and there\'s no way to turn it off. A couple of them will actually overwrite your Docker installation with a different version at install time. DDEV-Local tries to make sure that in the unlikely situation when anything needs to be changed on your computer, you\'re the one doing it and you have options. For example, HTTPS support requires running <code>mkcert -install</code> one time. <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/ddev-local-nfs-mounting-setup-macos/\">NFS support</a> requires a bit of additional setup. Because nearly everything is delegated to Docker, there is very little that needs to be done on the host computer in the first place.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Most importantly: the DDEV community</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Amazing community involvement and support</strong>: The DDEV-Local community has been phenomenal through the years, contributing ideas, code, and shared support. There are open collections of <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev-contrib\">DDEV-Local services, tools, snippets, approaches</a> as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/awesome-ddev\">blogs and presentations</a> and more from users around the world. You\'ll find very deep <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#support\">community support</a> in a number of slacks and Stack Overflow, etc. We are beyond grateful to all who have contributed to and shared DDEV, thank you!</li><li><strong>Amazing open source support</strong>: DDEV-Local is an open source tool developed at <a href=\"http://ddev.com\">DDEV</a>, where it is a privilege to focus on development and support of a free tool to help users advance and succeed. It\'s an amazing and unwavering commitment from <a href=\"https://ddev.com/about/\">our company</a>, and it gives DDEV-Local a significant advantage.</li><li><strong>DDEV in the Open Source ecosystem:</strong> Upstream and downstream, we\'re pleased to contribute and collaborate to a variety of open source projects, including: <ul><li><strong>Docker project</strong>: We\'re very involved with the Docker project, because DDEV users are always pushing the limits. We participate heavily in the <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues\">Docker Desktop for Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues\">Docker Desktop for Windows</a> issue queues, along with several others, and have recently become involved in a group that tests insider builds for Docker. </li><li><strong>mkcert</strong>: The <a href=\"https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert\">mkcert</a> tool allows DDEV-Local to provided trusted https in your local development environment. We\'ve benefited enormously from it and have contributed back tests and bugfixes.</li><li><strong>Xdebug</strong>: DDEV-Local is great with <a href=\"https://xdebug.org/\">Xdebug</a>, and of course we hear right away when there are problems and have been right in there in the issue queue.</li><li><strong>deb.sury.org PHP Packages</strong>: The Debian PHP packages (5.6 all the way through 7.4)  that we use come from <a href=\"https://deb.sury.org\">deb.sury.org</a>, and because the DDEV-Local community is an early consumer of those packages, we\'re often in that <a href=\"https://github.com/oerdnj/deb.sury.org/issues\">issue queue</a> too. </li></ul></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We\'d love to hear what makes DDEV-Local <em>your</em> favorite, and we\'re always <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#support-and-user-contributed-documentation\">listening</a> to hear what you want in the future... and of course we want to hear when things don\'t work the way you want or expect.

DDEV as a dev-to-deploy platform can be used to support the concept of GitOps because <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-local/\">DDEV-Local</a> and DDEV-Live themselves can be adopted into a GitOps process because they already align with several of the core GitOps principles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As Weaveworks CTO Cornelia Davis said during her presentation, the key elements of GitOps are:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>“You can GitOps just about anything.”&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Declarative Declaration</strong>. A declared intended state is taken and then interpreted. In our case, when a customer uses the <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/getting-started/#install-the-ddev-live-cli\">DDEV-Live CLI</a>, their commands are backed by declarative APIs. We’ll&nbsp; talk more about the declarative approach in an upcoming blog.</li><li><strong>Versioned Configs/Resources</strong>. The configuration of some or all of the workload is versioned using some form of source control.&nbsp;<ul><li>This could mean using Github to version things like Application Configuration, Deployment Configurations, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) etc.&nbsp;</li><li>This could also mean using a container registry like DockerHub or GCR to store versioned container images.&nbsp;</li><li>In our case: DDEV-Live can be utilized as a tool to achieve parts of a GitOps workflow.

By automating and increasing the frequency of small, incremental changes in a project pipeline, it’s possible to reduce regressions, increase velocity, and support shared success. But, configuring all your CI/CD tools to work together can be a disruptive hurdle in and of itself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether you’ve got a fully developed CI/CD pipeline in place or are looking to get started, DDEV delivers flexibility and straightforward integration to increase efficiency every step of the way. <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live</a> is designed to help developers to take advantage of cutting edge cloud technology while allowing them to define their own workflows. The resulting hosting experience is simple, scalable, and easily integrates with your team’s existing processes and favorite CI/CD tools like <a href=\"https://circleci.com/\">CircleCI</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>CircleCI is an especially attractive option at a time when client needs are becoming increasingly variable. Just like DDEV-Live, CircleCI is there where you need it, offering a cloud based CI but also on-premises or private cloud connections for your sensitive workloads. For agencies new to standardized CI/CD processes, CircleCI is also incredibly approachable, helping teams reap the <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/bringing-ci-cd-to-your-agency-with-ddev-live/#benefits\">benefits of continuous integration and continuous delivery</a> as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Already using on CircleCI and need to quickly deploy a test site, or in the mood to reevaluate your existing CI/CD tools?

With client and project requirements changing rapidly and revenue forecasts uncertain, tech leads have had to make tough calls for their teams. What do you do if the engineer who’s handling your deployments has to reduce their hours because they no longer have childcare? How do you continue <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-local/enabling-fast-flow-of-work-from-dev-to-deploy-with-devops-best-practices/\">driving consistency and parity</a> when your tight-knit team of in-office workers is suddenly remote?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A well-engineered CI/CD process will help you reduce risk while increasing the velocity of software delivery. More importantly, it eliminates your dependency on siloed developer knowledge, enabling the agency to improve ownership and deliver uninterrupted value to clients. However, no CI/CD process is futureproof. Maybe last year’s projects were best served by the <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/simplify-your-end-to-end-workflow-integrate-ddev-live-with-jenkins/\">easily extensible Jenkins</a>, but changing client needs have your team eyeing CircleCI because of its <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/enterprise/whycci/\">developer-driven configuration</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Flexibility is paramount for agile, resilient teams at any stage of their CI/CD integration journey.

Plus, its core components come built-in — eliminating the hassle and overhead of managing legions of plugins. There’s also minimal troubleshooting since all builds start in a clean environment and can be debugged by any engineer using SSH.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To get you up and running, we’ve created a <a href=\"https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/ddev/ddev-live\">DDEV-Live orb</a> with four available commands that will help you with install and authorizations, as well as allowing you to create new sites for every push that happens to the repository and delete sites following functional tests or reviews in a user acceptance testing (UAT) environment. Even if your clients use another hosting provider, you can set up previews of their projects by automatically deploying a test site via CircleCI onto DDEV-Live — saving the developer hours needed to go all the way to production.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ready to throw a few orbs at the wall and see what sticks for your team’s workflows?<strong> </strong>The best part is that connecting CircleCI to DDEV is as simple as this one-time setup: To get started, you’ll need a fully-configured account on DDEV-Live, a CircleCI organization configured to allow uncertified orbs, and a GitHub repository configured with the DDEV-Live GitHub app. Then you’ll follow this <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/circleci/\">six-step process</a> to connect your CI/CD pipeline with DDEV.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Futureproof Your Team</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No one has a clear roadmap for what challenges the future will hold.

If you want to leverage Kubernetes for production web hosting you may want a little help and management, maybe even split the costs of AWS or GCP with some other folks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s the goal of DDEV-Live: we want to give you all the cool stuff without the hassle of maintaining the cluster on top of maintaining your projects. Sometimes you just want someone else to do the cooking.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“It’s awesome that DDEV-Live is built on top of, and is <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/kubecon-barcelona-wrap-up/\">helping to expand</a> an open source hosting solution such as Kubernetes,” as Matt said in the livestream.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>DDEV-Live managed Kubernetes hosting&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/getting-started/\">DDEV-Live CLI and a fresh account</a>, spin up your own site quickly from your Git repo of choice. The details are in <a href=\"https://glamanate.com/blog/launching-drupal-9-site-ddev-live\">Matt’s DDEV livestream blog</a>. Here are a few highlights that stood out to us from Matt’s experience:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you’ve signed up and installed the CLI, you’ll run <code>ddev-live auth</code> to connect the CLI to your account on the platform. This is a great time to <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/organizations/#specify-organization-at-login\">set your default organization</a>. Matt said “The OAuth handshake with the command line tool is really seamless. Props to DDEV for doing that here.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some hosting providers, as Matt noted, don’t allow you to run a build process in production, you have to commit your artifacts and vendor directory (<a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md\">not recommended by the Composer documentation</a>) or use an intermediate CI build process. With DDEV, you can add a flag <code>--run-composer-install</code> on the platform when you create your site or later with <code>ddev-live config</code> and include <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/faq/#how-do-i-work-with-composer-on-the-platform\">additional Composer arguments</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For deployments, subsequent pushes to the Git repo/branch you created your DDEV site from result in automatic deployments to production. We’re continuing to build out some support around this, such as reporting on status and more documentation regarding what tools run each time and so forth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“You should always have scheduled backups going on your site. Not all hosting providers make this easy.” Database backups can be created, configured, pushed, pulled, etc in DDEV-Live. It is important to remember that a backup must be created before it can be referred to in a pull, for instance. You can find details on any command by appending <code>--help</code> to learn more. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Matt also checked out the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/providers/DDEV-Live/\">DDEV-Local integration for DDEV-Live</a>. This allows you to easily pull down a site from Live to Local and sets up a connection for future work. It works in the same way as the DDEV-Local integration for Pantheon except DDEV uses your Git provider as the source of truth for code. This integration and the automatic deployments to production are just some of the <a href=\"https://ddev.com/events/continuous-learning-nics-notes-from-gitops-days/\">GitOps principles</a> DDEV leverages to bring you a reliable, flexible deployment workflow.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Open source principles&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>DDEV is adapting and updating all the time; we’re constantly observing how the platform is used and where we can smooth out wrinkles and improve it for everyone. Thanks to Matt sharing his experience with everyone, we were able to queue up and tackle a series of changes to the platform and documentation. Many of these updates are in the most recent release of the CLI, ddev-live version v0.6.0. Run <code>ddev-live --version</code> to see your current version, and <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/getting-started/#install-the-ddev-live-cli\">upgrade via Homebrew or download the binary</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had a lively internal conversation about the logic behind flags for enabling/disabling cron, made appropriate changes, and are currently finessing some validation for cron jobs in the backend. There were underlying issues in the <code>ddev exec</code> command which surfaced during the livestream and were remedied with RBAC changes for a controller as well as informing ongoing work for the DDEV API. The livestream walkthrough also prompted us to finalize how we offer setting the PHP version from the CLI in terms of commands and defaults.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Up next, we’ll be adding more guidance to the CLI and UI onboarding workflow to make the process of signing up and getting started much smoother, especially changing the concept away from the “organization.” This has folded into some other conversations about terminology, where we often internally reference terms from Kubernetes, but on the customer side that’s been abstracted back to terms that should be more broadly familiar. As Matt said:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Overall I’m pretty excited. I love the fact that it’s a wrapper around Kubernetes, so you get all that awesomesauce.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also very much appreciated Matt saying, “When you’re working with a product and the company is open to feedback and has ways to give it easily, do it. That helps build a better product and shows their values— that they’re willing to listen to the customer and adopt some of the changes. Always recommend reaching out to the company, especially DDEV, they’re always really good on feedback.”&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Please, when you are using DDEV, do <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/support/\">send in feedback</a>, suggestions, comments, anything at all. We’re here to enable you to succeed, and your comments will lead to changes that benefit all users. Matt also thought to open <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/2357\">an issue</a> for a stumbling point in DDEV-Local, and made a point of searching to see if an issue existed already. Open source folks everywhere thank you for that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Watch and learn</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thank you again to Matt for sharing his first walk through with DDEV-Live!

He is also an advocate for <a href=\"https://t3oce.org/sessions/our-responsibilities-as-opensource-developers-anti-discrimination-inclusivity-self-reflection-open-minded\">demonstrating individual and community values</a> (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/E2AqmxQIMOs\">session recording here</a>), whether that is through writing a community statement in support of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helhum/status/1271030438455324672\">Black Lives Matter</a> or publishing and further <a href=\"https://typo3.org/community/values/code-of-conduct\">developing a code of conduct</a>. Helmut’s presentation covered a lot of topics and reminded me of my <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FoolIDaFQIc\">Drupal Diversity and Inclusion</a> group session.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Key concepts included: building a product for everyone. How can you know if your product is good for “everyone” if “everyone” isn’t represented on your team? As privileged people, we must take responsibility. Listen to and amplify people who have experiences different from your own. It’s our responsibility not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because it’s our job to build the right thing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the session, Helmut created a new channel in the TYPO3 Slack, named <a href=\"https://typo3.slack.com/archives/C01846XK010\">#cwg for community working group</a>, to talk about developing and enforcing the TYPO3 code of conduct. Hopefully we can continue the conversation and join with other initiatives to clearly show the values of TYPO3 and give space to underrepresented folks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>10 Things about TYPO3 v10</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>TYPO3 project lead Benni Mack presented on <a href=\"https://t3oce.org/sessions/my-favorite-10-features-that-did-not-make-it-in-typo3-v10\">what did and did not make it into TYPO3 v10</a> (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/e5elFltztng\">recording</a>). Of particular interest to us at DDEV is Benni’s process of evaluating web hosts to see what infrastructure might be available to run TYPO3 in a year or more and what long term support is like in order to determine the roadmap for TYPO3 itself. We’re continuing conversations with Benni and other TYPO3 users to make sure we are offering <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live hosting</a> that is suitably adaptive and flexible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In an interesting overlap with upcoming <a href=\"https://noti.st/francescamarano/EAkrMm/the-future-of-wordpress#sSPOY53\">WordPress features</a> (my recap of <a href=\"https://2020.wpcampus.org/\">WPCampus</a> is coming soon), TYPO3 has prioritized lazy loading images. No one wants high bounce rates that result from waiting for pages to load, or to lose viewers with slower internet connections. <a href=\"https://b13.com/blog/lazy-loading-just-got-lazier-in-typo3-v10\">Lazy loading is now active</a> for Fluid Styled Content in TYPO3 v10.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Making TYPO3 explicitly require Composer package management is not in the future of TYPO3 for now. Benni said that according to hosting providers, 90% of TYPO3 sites in the wild are not using Composer! Why? Probably the high overhead of converting a project and pipelines to Composer management. In the meantime, you can <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/typo3-guide/\">give TYPO3 and Composer a spin</a> on DDEV-Live just to try it out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>https://twitter.com/ekl1773/status/1289586125263130625</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Local Development Environment for TYPO3 with DDEV</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Peter Kraume has presented several times on how to use DDEV-Local to start up a <a href=\"https://t3oce.org/sessions/local-development-environment-for-typo3-with-ddev\">TYPO3 project for local development</a>. I was very pleased to finally catch him in action!

To <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/getting-started/\">deploy on DDEV-Live</a>, push your local project to a Git repository (<a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/providers/\">GitHub or GitLab</a>) and then connect to your DDEV-Live account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Starting a modern TYPO3 project from scratch with Composer and DDEV</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thomas Löffler brought all of these concepts together in a <a href=\"https://t3oce.org/sessions/starting-a-modern-typo3-project-from-scratch-with-composer-and-ddev\">live demo session</a>. I learned about <a href=\"https://get.typo3.org/misc/composer/helper\">Composer Helper</a>! It’s a simple wizard that provides a UI for selecting Composer packages for TYPO3 and returns a command for you to run locally.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also use <code>ddev exec</code> to run the TYPO3 Console tool inside the DDEV container, and add a short script to regenerate packagestates.php easily. With the provided details about .gitignore, not committing generated files, and creating a site package, you’ll also be ready to launch your local project through GitLab CI or other deployment tools.

The work must be tracked to facilitate collaboration, accuracy, and accountability, and the deployment pipelines maintained, standardized, and sustainable. Using a version control system such as <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a> to track work is the standard for development teams today, but connecting a Git repository into every step in an end to end workflow requires time to configure and manage. It might feel complex and intimidating, but with some patience and a little assistance from <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live</a> you can save a lot of time and stress.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>DDEV-Live is our hosting platform, which not only connects to— and in fact relies on— your project’s Git repository, but also allows you to work with atomic deploys, CI/CD workflows, and many other tools and services you may already be using. With automated deploys as a standard feature and room for customization, it’s possible to get those small pieces of work through the pipeline to staging and production quickly and accurately, every time.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using Git in your development workflow</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a> is a free and open source distributed <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control\">version control system</a> used by many of us to collaborate and develop both open source and proprietary software. Every project has its own Git repository, which must be hosted somewhere, often GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc. Our own <a href=\"https://github.com/drud\">open source projects at DDEV</a> are shared on GitHub, such as the <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/\">DDEV-Local</a> development environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While there is generally a central repository all work goes into, multiple streams of work can happen simultaneously, be merged without conflict, and you can track source code as well as static files. As <a href=\"https://www.tag1consulting.com/#team\">Tag1’s Greg Lund-Chaix</a> said in his <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fFmYkr8Ck5Y\">recent session on Git and DDEV-Local</a>: always work in a feature branch, pull the latest changes before you add your commit, and no editing on the server! It’s much easier to understand changes when everyone has been making small commits over time in clearly named branches which have been cleanly merged into the main branch of the repository.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Branches also allow you to contain and deploy discrete chunks of work based on the same codebase. For example, a set of new commits to a branch named “testing” can be deployed to a test server while the main “production” branch remains untouched on the production server. Or, a group of changes can be combined and tagged “myproject version 2.0” to capture that moment in development for future reference.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, you’re on board and set up with Git in general? You may be seeing some success with automation and the use of Git for version control but it’s been difficult to connect all the pieces and get the entire team into the workflow. To really start smoothing the wrinkles from development to deployment, it’s time to add DDEV-Live.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Deploy from Git to DDEV-Live&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live</a> is a modern hosting platform, built from the ground up on open source and <a href=\"https://ddev.com/devops/why-devops-containers-and-tooling-matter-in-digital-transformation/#containers\">cloud native principles</a>. When you connect your DDEV-Live account to your <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/providers/\">Git provider</a>, DDEV-Live watches for changes in your designated repositories and automatically deploys when a new commit is detected. That’s the out of the box, simple way to use DDEV-Live and Git.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/providers/DDEV-Live/\">integrate the DDEV-Local development environment with DDEV-Live</a> in a similar fashion, passing code through Git. For <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/bringing-ci-cd-to-your-agency-with-ddev-live/\">continuous integration and continuous delivery</a>, you can start adding in additional tools using your <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/authentication/#authenticating-with-a-token\">DDEV-Live API token</a>. Follow the tutorials for <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/circleci/\">CircleCI</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/jenkins/\">Jenkins</a> integrations, or just use them as inspiration for your own custom workflow. When an action or trigger is recognized by the DDEV-Live platform a new atomic (or zero down time) deployment can be initiated, including the creation of a fresh new container in Kubernetes (the underlying system in DDEV-Live).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This allows you and your team to take full advantage of Git, creating as many branches and tags as required. You can now set up a workflow to run tests, stage new work, and cut a release to push a new chunk of code. With one code base, we can track many deploys and versions, dependencies via composer, and configurations stored per environment. It’s very granular but connected to that one code base. The hosting industry is moving in this direction, using triggers to create and manage complex or simple workflows that the hosting platform is “aware” of.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This Git-based workflow also supports one of the core concepts behind DDEV, the “<a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/devops/dev-to-deploy-the-evolution-landscape-of-modern-web-development/#12factor\">12 factor app</a>.” For example, Factor #9 is disposability: We are not just creating a new build, we are creating a fresh new container for each new build or site. Or Factor #10, parity between development and production: Especially by working with DDEV-Local and configuring your development environment, you can be certain that your project does work exactly the same in production. Add in a staging environment on DDEV-Live for extra assurance, deployed from a branch named “staging” perhaps, and you’re well on the way to an efficient, safe, sustainable deployment workflow.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Safe deployments and freedom for developers</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It sounds like a lot, but by using Git to track your project through distributed development instances and DDEV-Live for automated, tagged deployments, you can save the time and manual work of shepherding changes through your release pipeline.

A virtual event can be more accessible for many people physically and mentally, as well as opening up the opportunity to people who can’t leave their family or fly across the world (regardless of pandemics). This is <em>fantastic</em>, I can’t emphasize enough the importance of inclusivity. When more people can join, participate, share, and learn the value to individuals and community as a whole far outweighs any direct business benefit.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The sessions I saw were all excellent, and while the live text chat next to a session in <a href=\"http://hopin.to/\">Hopin</a> was sometimes distracting, it was usually useful for sharing links, gathering questions, and connecting with other attendees. We don’t usually pass notes in person, but we sure did virtually. The “hallway track” morphed fairly well into the chat, as well as the chats in exhibitor booths where people could have conversations and wave hello at friends.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So many things make sense in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeslieMac?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LeslieMac</a>\'s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DrupalConGlobal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DrupalConGlobal</a> presentation: Empower local community members to do the work.

It was a little difficult to juggle the schedule from the events.drupal.org site with the schedule in Hopin, plus the addition of the contribution site and schedule. From the virtual events I’ve attended, there has been no unified solution to this. For Drupal contributions, we also wanted to bring new contributors into the regular space they would be using in the future, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/slack\">Slack</a>. Plus live tweets! I was holding down Twitter for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%40drud%20%23drupalconglobal&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\">DDEV</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%40ekl1773%20%23drupalconglobal&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\">myself</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%40drupalmentoring%20%23drupalconglobal&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\">Drupal Mentoring</a>, and following tweet responses to sessions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Understanding the possibilities for the booths and how attendees would interact with them took actually being in the booth live during the event. The value for sponsors was a little unclear, especially because sponsors often see the greatest value in “leads” which are a little more difficult to acquire and retain virtually. Reorienting to find other, more nuanced value such as via one on one demos, workshops, Q&amp;A or more gamification might be the answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Supporting the open source community</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whatever the platform and procedures, talking about it and sharing it early and often is key. For DrupalCon Global there were many demos, but details also kept changing, everything was very new, and until we could really get in and start participating with the full group it was hard to know how best to use the Hopin platform.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For booth staffers, offering something engaging and easy to drop in and out of seemed&nbsp; to be most popular (collaborative DJing? Making pasta? Testing hot sauces??). Offer something a bit fun alongside regular, clearly advertised product demo times and have additional team members on hand to take questions in the chat, and take notes for followup.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My personal experience is mostly from a developer/speaker perspective, so I would prefer to have the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpeDXSh4nHjQzENjcpLo6nO3A0AkBdF8w\">session recordings</a> publicly available soon after the event. Many speakers want to share with their team, family, clients, future employers. While I suspect the password has made the rounds, in the spirit of open source the videos should be freely available as soon as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Staying flexible is also crucial. There were a lot of rules at first, but as we became familiar with the platform I noticed that updates were made both to Hopin and to our DrupalCon instance to enable things that were going well. For example, Tim Lehnen at the Drupal Association was very open to giving us extra “live” booth time for Drupal Diversity and Inclusion, and many sessions/BoFs wound up having larger group chats. That’s the spirit of DrupalCon!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maybe for <a href=\"https://ddev.com/event/drupalcon-europe-2020/\">DrupalCon Europe</a> we can implement <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ekl1773/status/1283980831032324096\">the holographic mentor idea</a> as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>See you on the Slacks</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The benefits of a virtual conference are huge. Still, nothing is quite the same as seeing friends in person, exploring a new place together, and introducing new folks to the entire bustling experience. They are simply different creatures, there is no equating the two. I hope that in the future we can have DrupalCon Global every year, in combination with more localized events like <a href=\"https://www.drupical.com/\">Drupal Camps</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’re looking forward to seeing you in “Europe” and I am looking forward to working with everyone to organize and plan for more contribution mentoring and DDI activities!

Sergey also </em><a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases/tag/v1.15.0\"><em>contributed to DDEV-Local</em></a><em> by adding explicit support for Laravel.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In terms of local development environments (LDE), Laravel does have a lot of options. We have Homestead, Valet, Laradock, etc (In general, any PHP LDE can be tweaked to support <a href=\"https://laravel.com/\">Laravel</a>). They all do the job in their scopes. Now it\'s also possible to work on Laravel with <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-local/\">DDEV-Local</a>, an open source, Docker-based LDE. So why consider one more option?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Everyone should use the tools that push their productivity the most” — This is an important point for many developers and teams. And a lot of different tools are available; users have lots of choice.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you do set up an LDE individually, in most cases you want something that does the job with the least amount of effort to install and maintain it. As a Laravel developer, the first choice might be <a href=\"https://laravel.com/docs/valet\">Laravel Valet</a> (on Mac) or <a href=\"https://laravel.com/docs/homestead\">Homestead</a>, which are official Laravel tools and are mentioned in the <a href=\"https://laravel.com/docs\">Laravel documentation</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But when teams come together, a debate occurs about “what/how to use local development for the particular project/s.” At this point, worlds collide. Everyone is used to their own toolchain, might have a different OS, each project might have special requirements. All of this could become a “Holy War of Local Development Environments” inside the team or lead to everyone just using the tools they are familiar with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For a long time I have had the opinion that there is no need for big holy wars (debate yes, but not wars) about which tools are better. And, people should not be forced into using certain hardware, OS, IDE, etc. If a team member is productive in VS Code, then why force this person to use PHPStorm? (Just an example).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But in terms of LDE, if a team comes together and some team members use Valet on Mac, others prefer Laradock on Linux instead, and the Windows users go with Homestead, you could end up having to learn all of them to help solve problems with other team members’ preferred tool in the context of the project. Especially if the project has additional requirements like FQDN for SSO, custom Nginx configuration, etc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even if everything does run smoothly for a long time, you can end up with the “it works on my machine” situation. Team member A pulls the changes and everything breaks because team member B updated their local PHP version and some Composer dependencies require a certain PHP version. That leaves a lot of room for error, lack of safety in the process, and conflict on the team.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How does DDEV solve the problem?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As hinted above, I was dealing with a lot of different “tools of choice” across my team to help customize them to fit our projects’ requirements. We had team members who used Laradock, others (including myself) were using Valet, and some even used plain Nginx with custom configs provided by other team members. Sometimes it was hard to help everyone solve problems specific to their tool (some I described earlier).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, I was searching for one solution which would help to unify the experience by providing all the features they need, but still be very easy to switch to (regardless of hardware and OS) and of course easy for new team members to get up and running. And at some point I found <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev\">DDEV</a> and set myself the final goal:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Cloning the project should be (almost) enough for getting up and running regardless of the skills of the team member.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">DDEV-Local</a> combines a lot of the benefits of the other Laravel LDEs into one solution. In the context of a team, DDEV can bring additional benefits. It’s easy to learn for the members who set it up and customize it. And it’s super easy to use for the rest of the team to run multiple projects on any OS.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After initial setup and configuration of the project, you can commit the DDEV configuration in your project repository. The next team member only need clone the repo and run <code>ddev start</code>, <code>ddev composer install</code> and <code>ddev exec artisan</code> (to run migrations, etc) inside of the project (or you can simply define a custom command that will replace them). Every team member can override parts of the config (like enabling NFS support or Xdebug) without committing it. The time between cloning and starting work on the code is reduced to almost nothing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the end, the switch to DDEV did save a lot of time on the team (I have not heard about any LDE problems, since we switched :D ). That\'s also the reason why I decided to <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#laravel-quickstart\">“officially” add Laravel to DDEV-Local</a> as a contribution to the open source project.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Additional tips for Laravel + DDEV</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1. Add a dedicated DB connection for DDEV</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Normally, you can define the values of all the DB_* env variables to use DDEV’s DB container (it will even be proposed by DDEV when you start your project). But you can define a DDEV DB connection in your config/database.php to make it even easier. Here is an example:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php\n\nreturn [\n...\n    \'connections\' => [\n...\n        \'ddev\' => [\n            \'driver\' => \'mysql\',\n            \'host\' => \'db\',\n            \'port\' => 3306,\n            \'database\' => \'db\',\n            \'username\' => \'db\',\n            \'password\' => \'db\',\n            \'unix_socket\' => \'\',\n            \'charset\' => \'utf8mb4\',\n            \'collation\' => \'utf8mb4_unicode_ci\',\n            \'prefix\' => \'\',\n            \'strict\' => true,\n            \'engine\' => null,\n        ],\n...\n];</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Alternatively you can (and probably should) change the DB_* values in the .env.example, to bring the number of changes the end user needs to do to 0.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Add the artisan command to DDEV</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Normally to execute artisan commands inside the DDEV web container you would need to use <code>ddev exec php artisan …</code>. But to make it easier for yourself and your team, you could add the following content to the .ddev/commands/web/artisan file:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>#!/bin/bash\n\n## #ddev-generated\n## Description: Run artisan inside the web container\n## Usage: artisan [flags] [args]\n## Example: \"ddev artisan list\" or \"ddev artisan cache:clear\"\n\nphp artisan $@</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This way you can now just use <code>ddev artisan …</code>. It\'s trifling, but pleasant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3. Share It!</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many of us work on more than one project. Some projects could require similar customizations (ddev commands, nginx customization, etc). To simplify project updates, you can:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Place these files in a composer package</li><li>Require it in all your projects</li><li>Commit to all projects a command that will update this package and copy the ddev config parts to the project’s .ddev directory.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>4. Provide an example for config overrides</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In Laravel we are used to having an .env.example. You should do the same for your colleagues in the .ddev file. You can commit the .ddev/config.local.yaml.example with some frequently used overrides. This should make it easier for everyone to override the obvious things. Here’s the contents of my config.local.yaml.example:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code># router_http_port: &lt;port>  # Port to be used for http (if something else is running on default port \"80\")\nrouter_http_port: \"8008\"\n\n# router_https_port: &lt;port> # Port for https (if something else is running on default port \"443\")\nrouter_https_port: \"4430\"\n\n# xdebug_enabled: false  # Set to true to enable xdebug and \"ddev start\" or \"ddev restart\"\n# Note that for most people the commands\n# \"ddev exec enable_xdebug\" and \"ddev exec disable_xdebug\" work better,\n# as leaving xdebug enabled all the time is a big performance hit.\nxdebug_enabled: false\n\n# nfs_mount_enabled: false\n# Great performance improvement but requires host configuration first.\n# See https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/performance/#using-nfs-to-mount-the-project-into-the-container\nnfs_mount_enabled: false</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, as Laravel developers, we have a lot of solutions to make our workflow more efficient and enjoyable.

Every team member had to configure their local AMP stack for every project they touched, with no easy way to ensure parity from one machine to the next. Delivering a code base and assets to the client’s internal operations team for deployment meant physically flying to headquarters and sitting down with the team to communicate the requirements of the application and associated services.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That meant that any time a project moved, whether between team members for collaboration or to staging and production servers, environmental differences between development and delivery often surfaced, leading to hours of debugging and validation. As we struggled with handoffs to other team members and to the client’s operations team, we began to realize something was seriously broken with the process and the tools. How could a 15 minute code update take over 3 hours to get everything synced and updated live?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The problem was complexity. Each project needed environment configuration, importing assets, setting up customized services, databases, configuring web servers, memory allocation… etc. Once the site was delivered it would be under load experiencing pressure that was not easy to replicate in development. As complexity increased, we needed more hardware and extremely talented engineers who could navigate complexity and who weren’t easy to find. This led to exploring a solution that could manage the complexity in a way junior engineers could adapt to quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Solving complexity in web development</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To start solving this problem of complexity and collaboration, we began by simply documenting the process. By writing down the steps required to get a project set up on a local machine or moved to a production server, we were able to standardize and at least smooth out some of the speedbumps. Still, creating these complex sites for clients with lofty goals and very specific plans was causing us some big problems. A manual checklist wasn’t going to be enough for us to do this at scale, for multiple projects or multiple clients.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This realization led us to the major focal points for what would become the <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/introduction/\">DDEV solution</a>. First, even using scripted installation profiles and migrations, subtle differences would surface in environment configurations. We needed a more unified, reliable way to replicate production environments on local machines.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also had to have a way to merge and deploy changes automatically, in a way that could be viewed, tested and approved as a whole project, rather than individual PRs. It became difficult to find a place to host the projects clients had us building. None of the hosting providers at the time provided managed services that were designed to help the site succeed, hence the need on <em>our</em> team for engineers skilled in multiple disciplines to do the server management.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The concept of improving local development began to take hold initially not by planning to build a tool, but by scripting our checklists into installation and migration profiles. These scripts were then converted to Jenkins jobs to ensure management of external environments. While that was a huge improvement, it was very fragile and prone to unexpected errors in different environments.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The concept of finding a way to pull all of the changes together as a whole and run them in an environment that was fast enough and could meet our needs led us down the road to “self-hosting.” At the time, as an agency building these sites, we realized that while we <em>could</em> build a self-hosted production environment, that really was not our core business.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Building on the lessons we learned from managing agencies, building enterprise sites, combined with deep open source knowledge, we decided to spin out <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/about/\">DDEV</a> as a separate company. Our focus would be on advancing developers in open source communities by sharing the tools and processes we built to solve our own problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was at this intersection that we realized there was a significant gap for web developers, specifically PHP developers, that we were right in the middle of trying to solve. Like most startups, we looked in the mirror and said, “We can build a product to do this… it can’t be that difficult!”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It turns out that solving a complex problem is complex. Our overarching design goals from the very beginning for DDEV were focused on:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Reducing and managing complexity in the development process</li><li>Creating an easy way for team members to get a local copy of a project to work on</li><li>Creating a repeatable way for teams to work together using this process</li><li>Making best practices the easiest choice for developers</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If doing something the right way isn’t also the easiest and fastest way, then developers won’t be happy about it and their productivity will be adversely affected. To unify and simplify the experience, we’ve focused on providing a complete end to end solution for the development and deployment of complex web projects. Docker and Kubernetes have also enabled us to build the platform we envisioned thanks to mature container technology and communities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’ve taken into account the many steps in the process of designing, building, deploying and maintaining web apps and digital properties. Each project has unique requirements. Each client has different technologies in play. Each developer has unique skill sets. We are focused on creating a solution that allows each developer, client, and project a way to work together no matter what part of the project they are working on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>DDEV local development and hosting today</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 2017 we released our first supported version of our local development tool, <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev\">DDEV-Local</a>. The tool is fully open sourced under the Apache license and has benefited from over 100 contributors adding to the code, documentation, as well as giving presentations on usage around the world. DDEV-Local has attracted thousands of developers to adopt it as their standard because of the quick startup time, ability to run multiple projects at once, share with colleagues and collaborators, and customize configurations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#quickstart-guides\">DDEV-Local quickstart guides</a> available for Drupal, TYPO3, WordPress, Backdrop, Magento and Laravel, but just about any PHP project will easily run in DDEV. Some other top web applications that use DDEV include Sulu, CraftCMS, Symfony, Flexitype, Bludit, and plenty more, thanks again to the contributors who share their <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev-contrib\">recipes</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/awesome-ddev\">blogs</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some common daily use cases include sales demos, client sign off, team input, testing new modules or code and reviewing patches in the issue queue. DDEV has become part and parcel of daily work for thousands of PHP developers. As teams and individuals see success with DDEV, scaling that success by encouraging workflow changes, creating clean development environments and increasing collaboration is something that DDEV is committed to and drives the continued innovation of this product.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 2018 we released the first version of <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live</a>, our Kubernetes-based hosting platform. Earlier this year, in March of 2020, we released the second major version of DDEV-Live, focusing on more cloud native principles, GitOps concepts, and designed around an <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/\">API-first architecture</a> to allow developers an easy way to communicate directly with the platform.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Later this year we will be releasing some new functionality that will act as a bridge between the DDEV-Local development tool and the DDEV-Live hosting platform. We will continue to focus on enabling teams to have the best workflow dynamics possible through developing the DDEV API to offer flexibility and customization for all team project needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:block {\"ref\":2410} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','The DDEV Story','','publish','closed','closed','','the-ddev-story','','','2020-10-05 16:35:49','2020-10-05 22:35:49','',0,'https://ddev.com/?p=3307',0,'post','',0),(3358,1,'2020-10-13 12:13:12','2020-10-13 18:13:12','','BlogPosting','','publish','closed','closed','','blogposting','','','2020-10-13 12:13:12','2020-10-13 18:13:12','',0,'https://ddev.com/uncategorized/blogposting/',0,'schema','',0),(3359,1,'2020-10-13 12:13:12','2020-10-13 18:13:12','','WebPage','','publish','closed','closed','','webpage','','','2020-10-13 12:13:12','2020-10-13 18:13:12','',0,'https://ddev.com/uncategorized/webpage/',0,'schema','',0),(3360,8,'2020-10-13 12:21:45','2020-10-13 18:21:45','','LocalBusiness','','publish','closed','closed','','localbusiness','','','2020-10-13 12:25:51','2020-10-13 18:25:51','',0,'https://ddev.com/?schema=localbusiness',0,'schema','',0),(3364,16,'2020-10-13 15:31:15','2020-10-13 21:31:15','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Are you running a project using the <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/\">DDEV-Local</a> development environment?

Especially with PHP and other non-compiled programming languages, it was an “easy fix” to work directly on the production web server to see my changes – even when those changes weren’t working. However, our company b13 shifted to using <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git as a Version Control System (VCS)</a> in 2012, and looking back, I have no regrets about making that change. Here are a few WHYs on the power of a good development setup for myself and my company.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Need for Git</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When working as a single developer, keeping everything in a version control system seems a bit overkill. But Git has saved my butt hundreds of times. With Git:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History\">History</a>: I can find out exactly WHEN I added or changed some code lines, and if I stick to proper commit messages, WHY I changed something. This helps me trace down bugs more efficiently. And, regarding <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_committing_changes\">commit messages</a>: Especially when fixing hard-to-fix bugs, I set the commit message to a “Note to Future-Self” — because I can’t remember why I did a specific change 6 months ago. This does not replace a good habit of writing tests of course, but it acts as additional help for myself when maintaining code.</li><li><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell\">Branching</a>: I can work on multiple things in parallel in branches, or keep quick changes I found during browsing through existing code by changing something and putting it “in my stash.”</li><li><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows\">Collaboration</a>: Even if you start out as a single developer, at some point you may need to share your code with somebody else. Git has you covered, including all of the history and all of the branches. A Git repository can be cloned from any kind of remote (even from a colleagues’ computer), there is no central repository needed.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you fear the Command Line when thinking about Git, I can warmly recommend <a href=\"https://www.git-tower.com/\">Git Tower</a> which makes tagging, branching, merging, fast-forwarding and the concept of “remotes” much easier to grasp through the use of a graphical user interface.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you’ve started to be disciplined with making small commits, even as a one-person-show, you can build your code in logical components which you integrate and deploy continuously. This fact, plus the discipline of writing good commit messages truly made me a better developer, and you don’t need to have a Computer Science degree for that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The next logical step: Deployment</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that everything is in Git, uploading the source code files can still be managed manually through FTP/SCP, or you can even use Git on the production environment. This turns out to be very risky. I’ve seen environments where somebody commits a change into Git on production, while at the same time somebody else had made another change in the same file, and uploaded <em>that</em> change to production. These were the days where we all sat in one room shouting: who uploaded what first or last?!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This felt unnecessary, and we evaluated various alternative Deployment strategies. Deployment in this context is transferring a certain state of your source code and assets to a production environment, ie your web host. If you want to do this automatically, and in a repeatable way, we call it “Continuous Deployment,” ie “push the current state of this Git branch to the production environment,” multiple times a day. Those small changes and commits really come into play here.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For more complex web projects, some might need Frontend builds with npm, yarn etc, and defined dependencies for PHP with Composer to actually “build” the package you want to move to the production environment. You could also add Unit or Integration tests on your source code which should check that previous and new behavior works as expected. If you’re familiar with these concepts, you already have a “Continuous Integration” setup as well. Both terms are often referred to as “<a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/bringing-ci-cd-to-your-agency-with-ddev-live/\">CI/CD</a>,” and they cover the whole build process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the end, an automatic “build server” takes care of building the final state – an artifact such as a zip file – to be transferred to the production environment where it will run without any problems. No more yelling across the office!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s a win for all developers: Deployment is one of these things that you don’t need to do manually anymore. Having this process from commit to integration to deployment saves you time and effort.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A bonus: You could even deploy one Git branch (for instance, a branch named “staging”) to a staging environment and another Git branch (“main”) to the production environment, so your colleagues or your customers can <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/a-git-based-workflow-from-dev-to-deploy/\">test and preview each change on a separate server</a> before you push it to the production environment. This comes especially in handy when there are integrated services like external databases and APIs to test with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>But how do I develop locally?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that a CI/CD process is in place, the biggest question left is: Well, how do I work on my web project on my computer in an equally collaborative and safe way? Especially with teams, every developer and contributor has their own local copy of the web project, including the database and assets, on their machine. Develop locally, and I don’t have to worry about my internet connection, or if the upload of a changed file has succeeded, I can focus on the task at hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had been working with XAMPP, MAMP, and virtual machines, but Docker has had a huge impact in the past years. But if you’re primarily a web developer, <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/ddev-v-build-it-yourself/\">setting up Docker yourself</a> is much more complicated, and I can fully relate to that as I still feel like a Docker newbie.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately enough the folks at DDEV released <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/\">DDEV-Local</a>, which takes away all the pain from Docker and lets you focus on your PHP application development, whether it’s TYPO3, Drupal or any other PHP project. Install Docker and DDEV-Local and you’ll have a local environment, <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/customization-extendibility/\">configured</a> to match your production environment, with your Git repository, up and running in a matter of minutes. It’s the last piece of the puzzle needed to never directly touch the production environment again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To sum it up:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Using Git can save hours of work, even if you’re working as a one-person-show or don’t have to manage tons of branches.</li><li>With a repeatable and automated deployment strategy you don’t have to worry about the code on the production environment anymore.</li><li>Use DDEV-Local to make your life easier when you want to develop on your local machine.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a lot more topics to cover, like how to <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/providers/DDEV-Live/\">sync your assets</a> or visitor-generated content back to your local environment, but this always depends on the tool you use–in TYPO3 CMS world this is especially important.

Read all about it <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-local/why-developing-locally-matters/\">here</a> to get a grip on why you should start setting up a local development environment too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>From local to production - an easy task?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I started developing locally, this gradual change opened up a lot of possibilities I wasn’t aware of in the beginning:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>With Versioning through Git, I had a clear history of my modifications and could collaborate with my colleagues in a streamlined manner.</li><li>A local environment allowed me to continue my development when I wasn’t connected to the internet, when I was traveling.</li><li>By working locally, I did not have to debug on production to see my changes in effect but could test and bugfix faster than before.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I also had my fair share of lessons learned while having everything locally. One of the biggest challenges I faced was the different environments: Locally, I was running PHP 7.3, but the production server only had PHP 7.2, or didn’t even have all the PHP modules installed that I had on my local machine.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For composer-based PHP projects, we came around to the handy “platform.php” config to ensure that the dependencies match the same PHP version as on production. Still, everything else was hopefully working as expected, with many manual reminders to our team about which PHP functionality we were allowed to use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"backgroundColor\":\"very-light-gray\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\"><strong>References:<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.naderman.de/slippy/slides/2018-12-07-SymfonCon-Composer-Platform-Config.pdf\">Composer Platform Config presentation</a> from Nils Adermann<br><a href=\"https://andy-carter.com/blog/composer-php-platform\">Enforcing a PHP Version for Installed Composer Packages</a> by Andy Carter <br><a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#platform\">Composer Documentation on Platform Config</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some production servers used Apache as a web server, some used Nginx, and on top of that, especially when working with multiple web projects at an agency throughout one day, it felt like we ended up with more work than before. So I asked myself: Should I switch back to developing on the live server??</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Local environment = Production environment</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The solution for us was: Virtualization. We at b13 started to build custom virtual machines, or later on, containers with Docker, to match the same system settings as on the production environment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev\">DDEV-Local</a>, it’s just a matter of a few configuration lines to ensure that your local environment for a specific web project contains the same PHP versions and modules. And you can run multiple web projects at the same time. Configuring these settings felt like a no-brainer when starting a new project. I could even check if my application still works on a more recent PHP version and tell the IT admin on the production environment that “we’re safe for a PHP upgrade from our side.” The actual update on the production environment still might take months: Larger corporations with commercial Linux distributions usually rely on many old software packages. A lot of manual work is required to execute a system update.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The possibilities with Cloud-based production servers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If it’s so easy with Docker and DDEV-Local to change PHP versions, upgrade the system packages, why can’t a hosting provider do the same? Docker and Kubernetes have you covered in the container department. But that indeed isn’t something for me to configure as a regular web developer – I want to focus on my web application and my customers’ needs. Instead, I suggest choosing a hosting provider that offers such flexibility for you, so you can focus only on your local development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Going into the Cloud for hosting offers even more solutions than just quicker updates for your software packages:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: If your website hits a lot of traffic, you shouldn’t wait for two months to get new hardware and migrate everything over, the host should be flexible enough to cover the peaks.</li><li><strong>Failover:</strong> If a server is down, the system should detect this and spin up a new machine without any visitor noticing anything—a self-healing process.</li><li><strong>Exchangeability</strong>: When you deploy your code changes, or even an update to your web application, your site shouldn’t be down, but instead do a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment\">blue-green deployment</a>.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Kubernetes does that in a very sophisticated way –but to be honest– I don’t want to manage this on my own, as everyone has enough on their plate already. If you only want to work with your web application but have everything covered, <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live</a> might be just the right hosting solution for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>A straightforward deployment with DDEV-Live</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>DDEV-Live covers all the functionality from DDEV-Local, which already has excellent support for the popular PHP content management systems.

Perhaps you wanted to deploy a commit with the latest code for testing, or examine and share some new ideas in a feature branch with collaborators on the other side of the world. Or maybe you’d like your published production site to point to a tagged release of your codebase.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/a-git-based-workflow-from-dev-to-deploy/\">Centering your work around Git</a> supports safe and collaborative work, but how do you continue that best practice all the way to production? The <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-live</a> platform solves the problem of connecting a Git workflow from development through to deployment by offering the ability to specify a Git branch, tag or commit to pull code from.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Git best practices and deployment limitations</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you’re following a Git-based workflow, you generally have multiple pieces of work tracked in branches within the repository. There’s the “main” branch (the source of all truth), various branches for testing, staging, integration, as well as development branches with features, bug fixes, and midnight inspirations. During the project’s lifecycle, it’s likely only the basic testing, staging, or production branches that get deployed in remote environments.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But what if you want your production environment to pull code from a branch called “finalfix3” instead of being pinned to “master”? Or you’d like to build a unique QA environment from a single commit, separate from the deployment workflow. For hotfixes and random features the client suddenly wanted to see in a production-like environment (ie their browser), this can require more set up and configuration than it’s worth, leaving you considering whether you could just <a href=\"https://www.drupaleasy.com/blogs/ultimike/2019/06/sharing-your-ddev-local-site-public-url-using-ddev-share-and-ngrok\">use your machine as a host</a> for a few days (useful! but impractical in a complex work-from-home workflow).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Connecting and referencing your existing Git project with some web hosts requires a bunch of tools, a bunch of set up, and can be locked in to prescribed workflows. The inability to extend the structure and process you’ve built for your work limits what you can accomplish.&nbsp; Working with <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-local/why-developing-locally-matters/\">branches locally is massively flexible</a> when tracking various pieces of work in progress, as well as when merging work to build a release. <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging\">Tagging</a> chunks of work in Git is a standard best practice for tracking versions or releases for a project in the long term (a nicely documented example is <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/git/git-for-drupal-project-maintainers/release-naming-conventions\">the Drupal project</a>, which uses branches for versions and tags for releases).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, how can you extend your project structure and Git best practices throughout your development lifecycle all the way to deployment?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Deploy any branch, tag, or commit to DDEV-Live&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The DDEV platform is specifically built with a Git-based workflow in mind. Any time you create a “<a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/sites/\">site</a>” with DDEV-Live, you must reference a <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions\">Git revision</a> to pull the code from. A site can be created from a commit, tag, or branch from your existing GitHub or GitLab repository, creating parity for Git providers on the platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What does this look like in practice? You will specify the Git revision to deploy on DDEV-Live when creating a site with a command such as this example (<a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/sites/\">see more examples in the CLI docs</a>) referencing a branch named “dev”:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><code>ddev-live create site typo3 my-org/my-site --git-repo </code><a href=\"https://my.gitlab.hosting.com/repo\"><code>https://my.gitlab.hosting.com/repo</code></a><code> --git-rev dev</code></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>DDEV features automated deployments out of the box. The platform watches the Git revision you built the site from and rebuilds any time there is a change. If you’re already using a <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/ci-cd/\">CI/CD</a> solution in your workflow, DDEV can easily be added <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/cicd/\">using our CLI and API</a> (to automatically spin up QA environments, for example). One place where you don\'t want automated deployments is production. When you\'re ready to go live, all you need to do is create a tag in Git. You can deploy that tag to any non-production environment for a final test before switching your production site to that tag.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The freedom of flexibility</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With specific references to Git revisions you can be very granular about what gets promoted to production or staging and be creative with workflows and automation. You might have a DDEV-Live environment pointed at your production code in a “1.19.0” tag, a CI/CD tool scripted to spin up test instances for automated testing from a “QA” branch, and an on-demand instance to work with <em>that one commit</em> from last month.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Directly referencing and connecting to a central Git repository throughout your workflow gives you efficiency, cohesion and safety. Out of the box automation and the freedom to choose exactly what and how you want to deploy gives you flexibility to work the way <em>you</em> want to, the way your project and clients will benefit the most.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A sneak peek into the future!&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Currently, you could have work from a “qa” branch of your project in a DDEV-Live environment and share that work to anyone in the world from a preview URL. Next, DDEV is introducing more explicit support for temporary “preview sites” which are tied to pull or merge requests.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the near future, your DDEV workspace could have published, and ephemeral preview sites held in it referencing various stages of the project. For example: The published site is a reference to the “1.19.0” tag in your repository, and has DNS set up and is live online. A site built from your “qa” branch also exists. This branch is not published, but there is a PR against it with some changes. This PR can be used to quickly build a preview site by adding a comment to the PR. The preview site can then be shared via URL to stakeholders, and will be deleted when the PR is closed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’re very curious about how you’ll use some of these newer features and would love to chat with you about it.

Most software, including DDEV-Local, our <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live hosting platform</a>, cloud VMs, the most popular Docker images, and many upstream projects have traditionally assumed AMD64 hardware, and ARM64 versions were not always available.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"ARM\" stands for \"Advanced RISC Machine\" and \"RISC\" stands for \"Reduced Instruction Set Computer.\" The Intel architecture we\'ve all used so long has been dubbed \"CISC\" or Complex Instruction Set Computer.\" ARM seems to be the future. <strong>ARM64</strong> means ARM with 64-bit chips (there are also loads of ARM32 chips out there in the world). (The intel architecture is typically labeled AMD64; apparently after another manufacturer of the AMD64 chips, AMD.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Current versions of many devices already use ARM chips, including almost all Apple devices besides the Mac, Microsoft\'s Surface Pro X, the Raspberry Pi, Pinebook Pro, and many others.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What is Apple Silicon/Apple M1 Chip?

The <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/november-2020/\">availability announcement on November 10, 2020</a> made incredible performance claims. At this point, third-party testers are also reporting outstanding performance, even for older AMD64 apps (like last month\'s apps) that have not been rebuilt for ARM64.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apple\'s new <strong>Big Sur</strong> version of macOS (aka macOS version 11) has just been released, and runs on both Apple Silicon/M1/ARM64 and AMD64 computers. It\'s mostly just their annual OS update, but the big news is the Apple Silicon support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Rosetta 2</strong> is a feature implemented in the M1 chip and Big Sur which allows macOS to run AMD64 apps, even though they use a different architecture.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>DDEV-Local Already Runs On ARM64 in Linux and WSL2</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases/tag/v1.16.0\">DDEV-Local v1.16</a> already runs on ARM64 computers</strong> where Docker is available.

It involved:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Reworking all the DDEV-Local Docker images (ddev-webserver, ddev-dbserver, ddev-ssh-agent, ddev-router) so they could be built for ARM64.</li><li>Providing ARM64 builds of certain key upstream tools which were incorporated into Docker images or required alongside DDEV-Local, like mkcert, mailhog, and docker-gen.</li><li>Reworking the image build process to use Docker\'s new <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/blog/tag/multi-architecture/\">multi-architecture</a> support, which allows a single image on <a href=\"http://hub.docker.com\">hub.docker.com</a> to have both AMD64 and ARM64 versions, and to pull the correct one as needed.</li><li>Building the DDEV-Local Go binary for AMD64.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:block {\"ref\":3535} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>When will DDEV-Local Work on Apple Silicon?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People are just starting to receive the brand new macOS machines with Apple Silicon; we ordered ours and expect it to arrive in late November.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, Docker has the same problem as everybody else with getting Docker Desktop to run on Apple Silicon (see their <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/\">announcement</a>). As of November, 2020, Docker Desktop doesn\'t run yet on Apple Silicon, but they\'re promising a technical preview soon, and they\'re happy with their progress on it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides the dependency on Docker Desktop, the only other known issue in getting DDEV working on Apple Silicon is compiling the Go binary. The current version of Go, v1.15, does not support building darwin/arm64, the name of the architecture. However, the upcoming Go v1.16 (<a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle\">due in February, 2021</a>) does. And it\'s available a few ways right now. Experiments with building have been successful but, of course, we can\'t run on real hardware until we get it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So the answer is... DDEV-Local will hopefully run on Apple Silicon Real Soon, probably just after a workable Docker Desktop is made available.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:block {\"ref\":2410} /-->','ARM64!

One way to accomplish some of that, especially for a team, is to get set up with a <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/dot-com-vs-self-managed/\">self-hosted GitLab instance</a>. But it can be challenging to connect and integrate that beautiful workspace with external tools and environments in a way that just flows and doesn’t require extra context switching. We explored one way to directly connect self-managed GitLab with a production environment using a simple setup so you can keep working and start deploying.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>All customized and nowhere to go</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Setting up a customized instance of GitLab can be key to centralizing team work and making sure that code is stored in a safe and private location. A self-managed GitLab instance can fulfill customer expectations for privacy and professionalism when deployed on-premises or in your preferred cloud. The ability to manage users, logs, and much more also makes self-managed GitLab practical for growing teams and projects. GitLab features strong support for <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/11/11/gitlab-for-agile-portfolio-planning-project-management/\">Agile project management</a>, ensuring that work is broken down, organized, and tracked for the entire team. With development work streamlined and developers all working in one place you can be efficient, secure, and focused.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a digital agency, your team might need to keep work in very tightly defined pipelines as it moves forward. That means excellent project managers maintaining feature branches tied to epics and releases so chunks of work can be developed, tested and deployed in isolated environments. With all of that organization happening in GitLab, how can you connect the workflow all the way through to deployment for testing or production?&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to deploying a project, things can get sticky. In order to get the latest changes from a self-managed GitLab instance to the web host you might need to manually export and move code, leverage <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/\">GitLab CI/CD</a>, or employ another integration tool. The more steps there are in the process, the greater the chance for breakage, loss, and failure. Plus, even though all the code is in GitLab, you might have different build and deploy processes for each CMS, pointed to different hosting providers. Things get tangled and confused and the overhead of maintaining so many different pipelines eats time and requires significant expertise.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Deploy from a self-managed GitLab instance</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live</a> platform features the ability to directly <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/gitlab/\">connect a self-managed GitLab instance</a> to a remote environment on our infrastructure. You may already have set up DDEV for your <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#getting-started\">local development environment</a> with projects from your repositories. There are just a couple more steps to start deploying to your DDEV-Live environment from your self-managed GitLab instance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Configure a <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/gitlab/#configure-personal-access-token\">personal access token</a> on your GitLab account and pass the credentials to your DDEV-Live workspace via our CLI tool. Once that’s set up, you can run the <code>ddev-live create site…</code> command with a reference to any <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/how-to-deploy-from-a-branch-commit-or-tag/\">repository branch, tag or commit</a>. If you’ve configured your personal access token with the API scope, changes to the Git revision you referenced in the <code>ddev-live create site</code> command will automatically be pushed to DDEV-Live. This can also be <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/gitlab/#project-webhook-configuration\">manually configured with webhooks</a> per project or builds can be triggered by hand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That means you can now work in DDEV-Local with a project you’ve checked out from your GitLab instance, push changes up to the repository, and see an automatic build happen immediately on DDEV-Live. Everything can be controlled through the ddev and ddev-live CLI tools, and also be scripted in your favorite CI/CD tool using your DDEV API token.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Benefits of a flexible development workflow</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have a workflow and tools that you’ve set up to best support your projects, the last thing you want is to be disrupted. Any additional tools or systems you implement should make your process easier, not more complex, and should fit <em>your</em> process, not force you into workflows that don’t make sense for your developers, stakeholders, and projects. Something technically flexible to support a variety of PHP-based projects, as well as being adaptable and scriptable to integrate with other tools and providers. The best tool is the one that works <em>for</em> you, not against you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that you can connect just about any Git repo to DDEV-Live to deploy projects into the cloud, you can continue to save time on manual tasks and engineering effort in <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/ci-cd/\">setting up CI/CD systems</a>. For an agency with a self-managed GitLab instance you can work with the full DDEV platform while continuing to support the privacy, security and efficiency needs of your team and your clients.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For senior developers, the benefits might include time savings in setting up CI/CD pipelines for automated tasks. Instead of exporting code, you can directly reference your code right where it lives, in Git. Continue working with, or move to, self-managed GitLab to support your customer and internal project lifecycle needs. For all developers, the benefits include the flexibility to use the <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/providers/\">Git provider</a> you prefer (GitHub, GitLab, and more as we build out agnostic Git support) and logical, straightforward commands you’ll use to interact with DDEV via CLI, leading to saved time and resources and the freedom to use the tech you want.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The DDEV platform gives you the ability to continue using your existing, customized GitLab instance to manage all your work, but now with direct connections to deploy to DDEV-Live for any stage of your development workflow. With your API token and installable CLI, you can probably imagine a lot of possibilities for how to integrate DDEV into your current workflows.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, in addition to using DDEV in your CI/CD pipelines, you might also be in search of a way to spin up quick preview sites that can be shared. This functionality can support a really robust QA process with clients, where you can show work in progress that is only at the PR stage. Soon DDEV will include the ability to call up a fresh site on our platform based on changes in a PR you have created.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What does your workflow look like today?

And that is the casual web hosting feature. It\'s cheap and easy. It\'s open source. And I\'m sure you\'ll hear me say several times, this is not a replacement, for managed hosting, they\'re different things. But this is a way to get a site up onto the internet, maybe it\'s a specialized site, maybe low volume, maybe you just trying to show it off, maybe you\'re just maintaining it as you\'re demonstrating it to somebody, there\'s a lot of good uses for it. And let\'s take a look. So people have been liking D dev local for a long time they do the local development, they do a DD of config, they do a D dev start. And they say there it is, and they can change PHP versions, each project can have a different one, it\'s way easier than a normal server setup. So people say Can we do this on a server, and yes, now you can put a DD project on a server, and Ddf start and everybody in the world can access it. So there\'s a reason though, that it has casual and experimental all over it. So we\'re going to take a look at the caveats on it. The performance characteristics and server sizing aren\'t known. I\'m going to demonstrate today on a linode server, Nano Server a $5 a month, one gigabyte server. And I\'ve got a couple of I\'ve got a couple of my trivial sites already on one of these. And I think I\'ll add this one after we get done today. And of course, I could up up to the $10 a month version, and it\'d be fine. But the overall performance characteristics and sizing aren\'t known. And of course, there\'s no automatic way to scale it up like you would expect in a managed service. This isn\'t a managed service, you have to end up managing the host, on which Dev and Docker are running. And of course, from the security perspective, while the web image has been hardened, and sudo has been removed from the hardened image, there isn\'t any team of security experts signing off on this new feature. And I should point out to you that you may want to try some other techniques. If you\'re just trying to share your project right now, with a friend, you don\'t need to do this, just use the D dev share command. And it works great, it uses ngrok very easy to use. And of course, deed of the company has another product called D dub live, which is managed hosting. And it has some really nice features, and I encourage you to check it out. Okay, here\'s the requirements, you need a Linux machine, it needs to be reachable from the internet. And you need to have control of the DNS for the site. And of course, preferably for the server to so we\'re going to have set up DNS and pointed for both of those. Okay, let\'s go ahead and do it. What we\'re going to do for the server is we\'re going to spin up the server, point the server and site DNS to it. And then we\'re going to set up the firewall. And then we\'re going to create a user so that our user can complete the setup. We don\'t want to work with root on a server. We want to stop that as soon as we can, always so Okay, let\'s do it. We\'re going to spin up the server. Let\'s go to linode. Here, I am going to create a linode. And I\'m going to use a boon to 2004 because it\'s working really well with it\'s working really well with data of these days. It has the Docker and Docker compose that we need in it. So you don\'t have to go don\'t have to work as well as hard to install it. I\'m going to choose Fremont, California. And I\'m going to choose the nano plan the $5 a month plan. And we\'re going to call this demo the faze us.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4:33  <br>\nAnd I\'m going to tell it to put my SSH key in there for route already. So here we go. And this will take just a couple of minutes, but I\'ll pause while it\'s doing it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5:13  <br>\nNow,</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5:14  <br>\nso let\'s go ahead and do our do our next step here, we\'ve got it spun up. And now we\'re going to point the site and the server DNS to it. So we can use those easily. So here\'s the IP address, I\'m just going to copy that. And I\'m going to go over to my DNS. And the, the project, the site that we\'re going to move is PHP kgR consulting Comm. And so the first thing I\'m going to do before I try to move the whole thing, I\'m just going to move a test version of it. So I\'m going to say that I want to move demo.pk Hr consulting. And I\'m going to set it to one minute timeout. And here\'s my new IP address. I\'m going to use that. And now let\'s make a name for the server as well. And that\'s going to be demo dot the fes.us.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6:49  <br>\nWhat did I do wrong here?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6:53  <br>\nOh, I didn\'t delete it before. So here we go. I did a test run of this before. And I didn\'t delete this one. So I set it to one minute timeout. So it\'s probably okay, but we can get in there anyway. But I\'m going to change it to the new IP address. And let\'s just do one thing. While we\'re over here. I like to not forget to set the reverse DNS, when I\'m setting up one of these. So here\'s the IP v v. Four address. And I\'m going to edit the reverse DNS demo that that phase got us. Oh, it doesn\'t have the forward entry yet. It\'s, it\'ll be there in a minute. I\'ll come back to that after a while. So okay. Let\'s take a look at where we are. We\'ve we\'ve pointed the DNS adequately. And now we need to log in there and set up a firewall and a user. So let\'s go ahead and do that. So I can just go here, and I\'ll use the IP address for now to get in there because I\'m not sure that we can.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8:22  <br>\nLet\'s see if we can Oh, look at that because I already named this once it I have a clash.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8:34  <br>\nAnd I can get rid of it. It looks like I\'m already I\'m already on my way. Okay, here\'s my new site. This always bothers me to see localhost here. So I\'m going to set the hostname</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9:00  <br>\nMo Mo dot the phase. So I\'ve got the hostname set now and we are going to set up the firewall. So Ufw allow at, we\'re gonna allow Port 43 HTTPS port and Port 22 for SSH. And we will say Ufw enable and we know That it\'s good. So here we are. So we have Ufw status. And we have those, those things coming through. So we have our firewall set up, we certainly don\'t want to install Docker with the firewall off, we only want to allow through the particular places. Okay, so now we\'re going to create our sudo privileged user. So I am going to user add dash m, r Fe. And now we have the R fe user, we\'re gonna put it in the pseudo group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>10:53  <br>\nI guess that\'s not the right command. But I can just say, oh, it is the right command, I just didn\'t say R Fe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>11:13  <br>\nSo now our fe is a member of the pseudo group. So be able to use sudo. And let\'s set the password for our Fe. I\'ll need to use that for sudo a little later. And let\'s, let\'s go ahead and set up the RFA.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>11:39  <br>\nSSH settings. So I\'m going to I forgot one other thing I want to do. I want to set our face, shell to bash so that I can tell what I\'m doing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>12:05  <br>\nThere, we\'ll do an SSH key, Janet creates the keys in the right directory with the right permissions and that kind of thing. And now I\'m going to create the authorized keys file, so I\'ll be able to go in there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>12:26  <br>\nAnd</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>12:37  <br>\nI\'ll take my public key. And I will paste it in here. And my permissions a little more limited. And I should have everything I need to do is route should now be done. I\'ve got the firewall set up. I\'ve got my user setup. And so now we\'re going to log in as that user and install Docker in detail. So I will come back out of here. And I\'m just going to log in as an unprivileged user, and here I am, I\'m able to go right in there. And now we\'re going to install now we\'re going to install Docker and details. So let\'s take a look at the instructions for that. Here\'s documents instructions in the detail have read the docs. So we are going to just do this command apt get update and apt get install docker.io and Docker compose.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>13:54  <br>\nDid I type it right? Probably not. Got it right on the second time, though. And so yes, we do want to install those. Now, you never want to forget that on Linux, you have a couple of post install steps. So you have to add the user to the Docker group. So we\'ll do that right quick.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>15:02  <br>\nNow you see that our fe is in both the sudo and the Docker groups. If I do a docker ps, I should be able to talk to it, and I can\'t. So I will log in again. And now I\'m in. So I\'ve got the Docker officially added to my account now. So now we\'ve got Docker working, we need to do is install dedeaux. So let\'s go ahead to the docs for that. Here\'s the we\'re going to use the script to install, you can also use homebrew. But we\'re going to use the script to install it. So I\'m just going to copy here. And I\'m just going to paste. And this just curls the script and runs it. And we can see what\'s going on now it also installed make cert for us.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>16:02  <br>\nWe have data one dot 16 dot one here. So we should be good. So we\'ve got D Dev, and Docker. And now we\'re going to check out the code and import the files in the database. So I usually put all my projects in a directory called workspace that\'s a hangover from long ago using Eclipse. But that\'s what I always do. And that\'s where I was expect them to be. So I\'m going to clone</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>16:44  <br>\nthe code here for this. So now I\'m in the directory, there\'s everything I want to know. Everything I want to have. We\'re going to import the files and dB, I guess we need to configure it before we can do that. So let\'s do the Configure. We\'ll just do it with the additional Fq DNS To start with, No we won\'t, we\'ll just do a D dev config. It automatically figures out the project name, the doc root, the project type. And now I can do a deep dive start. Wait a second for these. For these things to be pulled? Really we should it disabled, PHP myadmin. And we should have disabled the</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>17:49  <br>\nSSH agent as well. So we\'ll do that in a minute. Okay, there we are, we have it running. We can\'t easily hit it with a browser yet. Because we aren\'t pointing the def site to it. And we haven\'t, we haven\'t put a database in there. So we just want to install anyway. So let\'s remember though to do the deed of config global</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>19:09  <br>\ndash dash omit containers equals data, SSH agent. And DBA. We don\'t need the the DBA which is the which is the PHP myadmin. And we probably don\'t need the data of SSH agent. Usually that\'s used in more of a development environment. So I\'m just going to do that and we\'ll get those done. And now let\'s let\'s get some files in a database up there. I always put files in a database in a directory called tarballs. So what I\'m going to do then, is I\'m going to copy from my system at home where I am here Have these files and database downloads. And I\'m going to SCP Star 2021 125 star to demo dot the phased on us workspace peak, hr consulting.com dot tarballs. So there I got those up there. So I\'ll just SSH in again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>20:45  <br>\nSo here they are, my project is running. And I\'m going to do a deed of import files, data source equals P.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>21:03  <br>\nI\'m going to get the files in there. And now I\'m going to do a D dope import dB. And we\'ll get the the DB in here. It looks like I did the wrong thing. That\'s the right command. So now we have a running site, I can curl the site.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>21:49  <br>\nAnd I should see a regular Drupal seven contents. And I do so I can hit that now. So I have a running site, and it has its files, and everything else. So we\'ve checked out the code, imported the files in the database. Now, what we\'re going to do is use an additional FQ dn for testing. So we decided to use demo.pk, PK hr consulting.com as our site. So let\'s do that. Oh, did we already do it? No, we didn\'t add any additional Fq DNS yet. Demo dot pkg are consulting.com. And now we need to do a couple of global configuration here. We need to tell DD of globally to bind all interfaces, which means listen to the outside world. In a development environment. We don\'t want to be listening to the outside world. And we\'re going to guess here\'s the omit containers. We already did that. We\'re going to do the use hardened use hardened images, use Let\'s Encrypt and Let\'s Encrypt email. So let\'s do that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>23:49  <br>\nAnd what else do we have to do? We already did the omit containers on router by router bind all interfaces has to be done.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>24:02  <br>\nOkay, there they all are. We have the we have everything set up here. And we can do it. We\'re going to do a df power off so that the so that we start over with all the right images in the right global configuration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>24:30  <br>\nNow we\'re going to do a deep dive start. Let\'s just let\'s just ping demo dot p hr consulting.com and see if it\'s resolving and it is resolving. So that\'s good. So we\'ll do a deep dive start. And it has to pull the hardened image since we now change the configuration to require the hardened image</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>25:37  <br>\nThe router is negotiating with Let\'s Encrypt to get that to get that new cert. And so we should have the new cert now. And we should be able to hit HTTPS demo dot pkg consulting.com. And it could even work. And it did work. That\'s amazing. There it is, if you look at the certificate, you\'ll see that it was just issued, it\'s it expires in February. It\'s now November, this is three months from now. There it is. So we\'ve got demo dot pkg, or consulting going. So that\'s good, we can go around to it, we can log into it. All those things. So we\'ve done our DTF start, it\'s working. And there\'s some things that you\'d want to do after that. So the next thing that we\'ll do, and we might as well do it right now is to add the real domain to the project. So what we\'re going to do, we didn\'t, we didn\'t want to do this until we had tested the product tested the site to make sure that it was working.

Now we have the new one, you can tell that it\'s a new cert, it\'s got the February 23, we\'ve got the site moved up there. Let\'s just take a look at the status report. It needs to have the database update script run on it. So we got a little bit of work to do. But things are looking pretty good. We can check for updates. It\'s a real live site. So there we are. Let\'s take a look at what else we need to do. So follow up, we just added the real Fq dn the fully qualified domain name, PK hr consulting.com, to the live site, so it actually moved over. We we set the DNS to point to it, and then we did a restart, and I did have to do a deed of power off. And it did have start to get the router to renegotiate probably as we started to quickly after changing the domain name and DNS, the the instructions in the list, just take a look here. here\'s the here\'s the casual web posting section of D dub dot read the docs.io. And it tells you how to set up. So that D dub will automatically start on system setup because on systems system boot, you certainly want that. So there\'s a there\'s the technique for doing that. So you want that you probably want your containers to auto restart, that\'s a global configuration. You want to enable outgoing mail from the site, if you have any transactional email, especially mail usually would go to you but if you have any transactional email, and you have to in enable outgoing, you probably want to enable outgoing email from the server and tell it where to go so that you get notifications. If the server has trouble, those we won\'t go into those. Setting up outgoing email from the site usually means installing an SMTP module and bouncing it through one of them, you know, mailgun, or one of the email providers like that. And you probably want to configure off site backups, that\'s another that\'s can also be done with a modular plugin. There\'s many other ways to do it, you can you can do D Dev, export dB, and save the file if you want to or D dev snapshot. And reverse DNS. I was almost going to do that at the very beginning. But I recommend that you do set up reverse DNS helps mail to work. So we got it. We got it going.

The details are a little different from CMS to CMS, but the big picture stays mostly the same. Please note that many people have many opinions about all of this, and some people will disapprove of what I say, but it\'s intended to teach you the basic process, not the exact procedure. It also will necessarily be incomplete, since there\'s no way to cover every platform or CMS, or every permutation of deployment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li><strong>Move the code for the website</strong>. If the site is just an HTML/JS site, you\'re done. (Typically the code is checked via Git or some other source management situation, so it can be checked out in the new location.)</li><li><strong>Move the database</strong>, which has dynamic content in it. In many cases this is just one database, but in complex situations it could be more than one database.</li><li><strong>Move the user-generated or dynamic files</strong>. On Drupal, for example, the sites/default/files directory typically has all these user-generated or dynamic files. (There may be more than one directory of user-generated/dynamic files. In Drupal there may be private files in a directory outside the docroot.)</li><li><strong>Move the exported configuration</strong>. In Drupal 8+, for example, the config_sync_directory has this explicit exported configuration.</li><li><strong>Build the site in the new location</strong>. Although older sites didn\'t have a build process for deployment, almost all the newer ones do. At the very minimum, this is typically a <code>composer install</code> to populate the vendor directory, which is often not checked into code. But there may be far more sophisticated requirements to the build, like an <code>npm install</code> or a <code>compass compile</code>. The basic idea is that your site may have a deployment build process which will have to be replicated in the new location.</li><li><strong>Configure database settings files</strong>. Normally the database credentials on one server will not be the same as on the other, so you\'ll need to update the database settings as your CMS or platform requires.</li><li><strong>Transform URLs if necessary</strong>. Some CMSs like WordPress, Magento, and Shopware, have a tendency to bury multiple references to the site URL inside the database, so a transformation has to take place after all this is done. We wish they wouldn\'t do this of course, but we have to live in the world we live in. Read about <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/sharing-a-ddev-local-project-with-other-collaborators/\">how to transform URLs</a>. You\'ll need to understand how to manage this in your particular CMS, as each does it differently. (Note that in Drupal, TYPO3, and Backdrop at least, incorporating a full self-referencing URL inside dynamic content is at least a party foul, probably worse, and it ruins standard deployments.)</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Simplest deployment: Drupal through Drupal 7 - code, database, user-generated files, no build process</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Up through Drupal 7, all you had to do to move a site in many cases was to check out the code, load the database from a database dump, and get the files into sites/default/files where they belong.

Many of us have staging environments, alpha environments, dev environments, several local servers on our machines and of course various continuous integration tools. All of those require at least a couple steps to get your work in progress “live” and may also be locations that you can’t <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/sharing-a-ddev-local-project-with-other-collaborators/\">just share</a> with collaborators.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With this in mind, and based on the feedback of real live DDEV users, we’ve just added the first features of what we’re calling “<a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/#ddev-preview\">DDEV Preview</a>” to the platform on all tiers and as part of the <a href=\"https://dash.ddev.com/pricing\">personal free trial</a>. Preview allows you to create a temporary staging site with one command directly on a pull or merge request. Let’s look at how this can be helpful!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:button {\"backgroundColor\":\"luminous-vivid-amber\",\"textColor\":\"very-dark-gray\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-very-dark-gray-color has-luminous-vivid-amber-background-color has-text-color has-background\" href=\"https://www.ddev.com/news/release-notes-ddev-platform-23nov2020/\">Read the release notes here</a></div>\n<!-- /wp:button -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>When you need to stage and demonstrate work in progress</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a developer who does not want to break production, you likely do a lot of testing and staging before tagging and releasing new work. You may have found that despite best efforts with continuous integration, staging environments go stale and require extra attention when you go to use them. Along the way you’re losing hours on each project in getting all environments up to speed, not to mention finding clever ways (that aren’t piles of screenshots) to show clients work in progress, get approval and feedback on user experience, and more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s not all, either - you’ve got a wide variety of projects, various CMSs, configurations, dependencies, and services connected to each of them. There’s not much of a one size fits all approach so each needs a series of environments for dev, test, stage, production, especially when clients each have their favorite hosting providers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In summary, it’s complicated, and it’s a lot to manage. That’s why, at the request of DDEV users, we added the capability to create a quick, temporary preview site with the latest changes from your Git repository.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Integrated preview sites with GitHub and GitLab</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/news/release-notes-ddev-platform-23nov2020/\">first set of features</a> for DDEV Preview, the author of a pull or merge request (we’ll just say PR here) can now build a site directly from that PR with a comment. The DDEV Preview Bot on GitHub or GitLab watches for PRs against branches that are deployed (but not necessarily published) on <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live</a> and automatically comments on a PR when it is created.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Preview site is deleted when the PR is closed, so you don’t wind up with stray sites counting against your overall account quota on DDEV-Live (assuming you keep your PRs tidy!). That means you’re automatically conserving resources in terms of platform costs, too. Preview can be used independently of DDEV hosting services. You can use Preview if you are a <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/\">DDEV-Local</a> user, or anyone with a GitHub/GitLab repo, and just want to have a Preview site but not a published production site hosted on DDEV-Live.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using Preview in conjunction with other DDEV platform features can further smooth the process of taking a feature, bug fix, or new site from local development to live deployment. The time savings an end-to-end integrated system offers adds up and gives time back to everyone involved. Developers can focus on getting the feature right, project managers can spin up preview sites to hand over to business for client check-ins, and return on hiring and infrastructure investment is maximized across the organization.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Here’s an example of how you in the real world might use this feature.&nbsp;</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have an account with DDEV-Live (in this example, we\'ll use GitHub, which requires the DDEV-Live GitHub app installed on your GitHub account and the  ddev-live CLI installed on your machine) and <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/how-to-deploy-a-site-with-ddev/\">deploy a site</a> from a branch via a <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/drupal-guide/\">command</a> such as:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><code>$ ddev-live create site drupal my-drupal-site \\<br>     --github-repo my-github-org/clientsite \\<br>     --branch workingbranch \\<br>     --drupal-version 9 \\<br>     --run-composer-install</code></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now you have a copy of the code in your branch <code>workingbranch</code> available on DDEV-Live, but not published with DNS etc. You also push your database and file assets.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is where DDEV Preview comes in. For this example, let’s say your client wants to see the current work on their new website theme <em>right now</em> (<a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/watch-ddev-live-preview-feature/\">watch Randy’s example with a theme change here</a>). Commit and push your local work to your GitHub repository <code>clientsite</code> on the <code>workingbranch</code> branch, and create a PR from that commit.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because you have that branch deployed on DDEV-Live already, our <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/preview-bot/\">preview bot</a> will automatically recognize the PR against the deployed branch and will comment on the PR to ask what you would like to do next.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Run the suggested command <code>/ddev-live-preview-site</code> and the bot will build a preview site using the code in your PR and the assets from the previously deployed branch to show your work in progress as it would appear “live.” The bot returns a URL you can share with your client, displaying how their site will look with the new theme and their existing blog posts and images. They can validate that you’re on the right track and you can close the PR (automatically deleting the preview site) and continue working.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Launch and learn!</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What are you missing in your development workflow today?

Any site of type “clone” is also automatically deleted when the origin site is deleted, so there are no orphaned site clones.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Q: What if I want my Preview site to expire at a different time, such as 24 hours after creation?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A: You can add a site expiration via the ddev-live CLI as you would for any <code>site</code>. First run <code>ddev-live list clones</code> or check your PR for the Preview &lt;site&gt; name, then run <code>ddev-live config drupal &lt;site&gt; --expires-in 1d</code>. <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/sites/#setting-expiration-on-your-site\">Read more about site expirations in the docs</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Q: Can I use the bot with <a href=\"http://gitlab.com/\">gitlab.com</a> or only with self-hosted GitLab installation?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A: Using <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/gitlab-bot/\">the bot on gitlab.com</a> works the same as on self-hosted GitLab.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Q: How can I specify a database for my Preview site?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A: As a Preview site is a clone of an origin site, it automatically receives a clone of the origin site database at the time of the creation. Once created, the origin and clone databases may diverge, and can be optionally synced using <code>ddev-live push / pull</code> if desired.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The same applies for the file assets. The file assets are cloned without a delay using copy-on-write file system, so the clone site receives its assets instantly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To replace the default cloned database, you can use <code>ddev-live push db &lt;pr-site&gt;</code> to <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/databases/\">push a separate prepared database in</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Q: Is there an extra charge for the Preview features? Is there a limit? Do they time out?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A: Preview is included on all <a href=\"https://dash.ddev.com/pricing\">DDEV-Live plans</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A Preview site from the perspective of billing and quota management is the same as any other site. For a plan which includes N sites, you can have up to N sites on DDEV-Live in total, regardless of their type (regular “site” or “clone”, for example).&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By default, Preview sites don’t timeout, except when their lifespan is tied to the PR they were created on - then they are deleted when the PR is closed. It is also possible to use <code>ddev-live config [site-type] [site-name] --expires-in=[duration]</code> to <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/sites/#setting-expiration-on-your-site\">configure any site’s expiration</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Q: If my plan includes 5 sites, are there rules as to how I allocate those sites for Preview, production, etc?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A: The limit is for all types of sites in total. If you have a cap of 5 sites, you can have 1 origin + 4 clones; or 3 origin + 2 clones, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To put it slightly differently: you may choose to have one Preview site for each site you deploy on DDEV-Live, or have one production site (live on the web), two deployed non-production sites, and two Preview sites that reference one of the deployed sites as their origin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Q: What happens if you use the maximum number of sites and then try to launch another Preview?</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A: The PR bot will inform you on the PR that you are about to hit your quota.

As I reflect on where we started in 2013 and what lies in front of us for 2021, I can\'t help but feel a deep sense of gratitude and excitement for what the new year brings. In 2013, I watched an industry growing from the grass-roots efforts of millions of open source contributions into proprietary systems designed to capitalize on contributors.  As we enter 2021, I believe the tools to break that cycle are reaching maturation, and I\'d like to help you understand how DDEV will continue to help.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Successful web developers must solve three fundamental problems to focus on their craft.  The first is creating a working environment. The second is delivering the results of the work, and the third is collaborating with others. These three areas are at the root of why we created DDEV and why we love to hear what you need from the tools. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/\">DDEV-Local</a> is an extendable, container-based local development environment for developers.

By focusing on containers, it allows for significant customization limited only by your creativity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Deploying from local to environments of your choosing should be seamless. Establishing frameworks to deploy to existing cloud platforms or bare metal is a significant focus for 2021.

We ended 2020 by enhancing our hosting capabilities with <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/#ddev-preview\">DDEV Preview</a>, which can replicate environments based on pull requests. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 2021, you will see broader integration with local development tooling and existing workflows through a series of language-specific SDKs that expose platform integration to any number of tools or processes.

After the virtual <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/europe2020\">DrupalCon Europe</a> in December a few folks caught up on social Zoom, where I learned that a couple of my longtime friends in the Drupal community are using <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/\">DDEV-Local</a> to teach web development to newcomers.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mauricio Dinarte was one of my first mentors when I started learning Drupal in 2013, so it was an honor to interview him for this blog. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/dinarcon\">Mauricio</a>, aka <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dinarcon\">dinarcon</a>, has been doing Drupal for a decade now and teaching Drupal for half that time locally in Nicaragua as well as at Drupal Camps and Cons worldwide. This is the first blog in a set, please read more about <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/why-standardization-is-important-to-teaching-web-development/\">teaching Drupal in Iceland from Hilmar Hallbjörnsson</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What do you teach attendees about Drupal and React and what are some of the challenges in getting them started?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I teach <a href=\"https://agaric.coop/training/getting-started-drupal-9\">Drupal site building</a>, <a href=\"https://agaric.coop/training/drupal-content-migrations\">Drupal migrations</a>, <a href=\"https://agaric.coop/training/upgrading-drupal-using-migrate-api\">Drupal upgrades</a>, and <a href=\"https://agaric.coop/training/getting-started-reactjs\">ReactJS basics</a>. I present sessions at events, which are a lecture style, and workshops going over specific examples and hands-on exercises. That has been quite different when they used to be in person versus now that they are online. Before, you were able to see someone had an issue, sit next to them and try to work together out of the problem. But now it\'s mostly online and depending on the size of the class, it’s not possible to let the attendees screen share. So that is a challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes the setup is as simple as sending over links to repositories and lessons. Sometimes it’s using the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/installing-drupal/drupal-quick-start-command\">quick start command in Drupal</a> or something like <a href=\"https://www.drupalvm.com/\">DrupalVM</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev#ddev\">DDEV</a> for more advanced classes. In all scenarios, no matter what the topic is, I strive for keeping it very, very simple in terms of the <a href=\"https://github.com/dinarcon/drupal_migrations_basic/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md\">local development environment</a>. It is not always possible, but that\'s something that I really look for: some way in which there is the least amount of effort from getting started to having a functional site and, depending on the course, writing the first line of code.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How are you supporting students and adjusting to fit a more virtual, online format?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>About two weeks ago, I gave a presentation on <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/layout-builder\">layout builder</a> to a small group. We were using <a href=\"https://www.mamp.info/\">MAMP</a> and <a href=\"https://pantheon.io/trainers\">Pantheon environments</a> to deploy, because it was not about explaining everything but just the essence of the tool. With some set up in advance I was able to start the training, so that was right for this instance. But in general, with online trainings, there have been a lot of challenges. Funny enough, most of the challenges go back to what I was describing - the local development environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, along with my colleagues at <a href=\"https://agaric.coop\">Agaric</a>, in 2020 we presented three or four different <a href=\"https://agaric.coop/training\">online workshops</a>. We would spend hours, and hours, and hours giving people support ahead of the training to get their local environments ready. We have seen so many different setups, every computer is different. It can get complicated. That is why we offer office hours before the trainings to help people get ready. We also offer training recordings so everyone can practice later. Again, the key is having a simple set up with a local environment to begin with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>That goal of having quick wins when getting started coding sounds similar to our work with <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/community/mentoring\">Drupal contribution mentoring</a>!&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yeah, requiring the least amount of effort to get started is ideal — because in the context of mentoring, people want to contribute to Drupal as an open source project, and in the context of a training they want to learn a new skill. They don\'t necessarily want to learn Docker, Composer, LAMP stacks, or virtual machines to be able to contribute. That\'s why, depending on the topic and issue I choose the development tools that meet the minimum requirements to get them started.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How do you determine which development tools are best for Drupal migrations or getting started or… ?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These have changed over the years. When I started presenting the Drupal workshop back in the day as part of the <a href=\"https://groups.drupal.org/global-training-days\">global training days program</a>, I used <a href=\"https://simplytest.me/\">simplytest.me</a>, an online tool for installing Drupal. Back then the installation would only be available for two or three hours. I remember talking with <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/patrickd\">Patrick Drotleff</a>, the creator of the tool, when he was extending the lifespan of temporary sites to about 24 hours. This allowed us to give a full day training using simplytest.me alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before that, we would spend two of the three hours just trying to get an *AMP stack on each person\'s computer. It was inefficient and frustrating. That’s the friction that we wanted to avoid - people want to learn something new and then they discover that they need to learn twenty other things to be able to start being productive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Later, I started using Pantheon for the Drupal site building courses, because they have the free tier with no time limits. Pantheon also has a program called <a href=\"https://pantheon.io/trainers\">Pantheon for Educators</a> where trainers like me can create environments on behalf of their students in advance. On the day of the training, we jump directly into the content, we don\'t need to worry about “Do you have LAMP stack on your computer?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For Drupal Migrations it\'s a little bit different because we know we need more setup than just an out-of-the-box Drupal installation on Pantheon. Some modules need to be installed via composer. Depending on how the Pantheon site is set up, this might require configuring SSH keys . To keep things simple, I default to the Drupal quick start command. That uses the built-in PHP Web Server, SQL lite, and PHP itself. With that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/dinarcon/drupal_migrations_basic/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md\">get a Drupal installation in five to 10 minutes</a>. That does require a little bit of technical knowledge and having PHP and Composer installed on your computer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a part of <a href=\"https://understanddrupal.com/\">UnderstandDrupal.com</a> I recently released a <a href=\"https://understanddrupal.com/migrations\">Drupal Migration training</a>. In the lecture on debugging migrations I use DDEV because it\'s very simple to <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/ddev-local-phpstorm-and-xdebug-debugging/\">install DDEV and to configure Xdebug</a>, so that was kind of the selling point. It was literally just issuing a command, setting a breakpoint, and allowing the IDE to listen for connections. And that was it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before DDEV I was using DrupalVM for many years. It works great if you have VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Ansible installed in your machine. But getting them properly configured in the first place can be challenging in some environments. So, you need to make a decision: to install VirtualBox or Docker. Attendees might come to a training with <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#system-requirements\">Windows, Linux, Mac</a>. Sometimes they do not have admin privileges on that machine. I have fought many of those battles. And I don\'t consider myself a sysadmin! So the simpler the tool, the better for me. That\'s basically why I chose DDEV.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Tell me a little more about your experience using DDEV for local development? What was especially useful or lacking?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Definitely useful how easy it is to configure Xdebug. Coming from DrupalVM I was really looking forward to how to debug, which works out of the box. But the highlight of DDEV is <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/author/rfay/\">Randy Fay</a>! I post a question in the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#support-and-user-contributed-documentation\">#ddev Slack channel</a> and he answers within minutes! Sometimes I just lurk in the channel to learn from others. Randy is so good at offering support, not only on a technical level. He also takes the time to explain how things work. That is a big asset for DDEV, you know, having someone who is able to offer support in a timely, kind, and humane way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only thing, which isn’t specific to DDEV, is that in order to get the local environment working you need Docker installed. That might be a challenge in itself. For example, two days ago, I was working with a client who was having problems with the DDEV installation. And the reason was because they had just updated Docker desktop and that broke things. Of course the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#system-requirements\">system requirements</a> are in the docs, but sometimes people update their tools as soon as new releases are available without checking compatibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What are the needs and goals of the students who sign up for Drupal web development trainings? Who are they?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Recently in my local community we noticed when we promoted the training as “Get started with Drupal” people didn’t know what Drupal was. So we switched the name to “How to build a website in a day” and got much more interest. We’re often teaching small business owners how to build a simple website for their business. While covering ecommerce integration is not feasible, we teach them how to build a product catalog in a day.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have also given many sessions and trainings to university students majoring in computer science and design. The course is always tailored to the audience. So we talk about theming, reusable components, and modules to highlight Drupal’s flexibility and provide foundational knowledge. Sometimes we have attendees in leadership roles, or project managers, who come to a training to understand the bigger picture. They want a sense of the tools, what is possible, what is recommended so they can be a bridge between developers and stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the Drupal migrations trainings, that audience is varied. Sometimes they’re the one technical person in the organization who has been tasked with doing the update. The introductory course is friendly to just about anyone since it only requires understanding of site building concepts like nodes and users. Intermediate and advanced migration courses require some programming knowledge, but provide detailed instructions and examples as necessary. They may also obtain Drupal upgrade training which does require more PHP knowledge and a more complex local environment setup. Getting the two versions of Drupal talking to each other is when people start to lean on our support and office hours. Sometimes attendees just need to solve a specific problem, and that is again when we need to get them started with as little friction as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some audiences benefit more significantly from migration trainings. For example, universities or governments who have hundreds of sites: They learn once and apply the knowledge multiple times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What are your teaching goals for 2021?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I want to expand <a href=\"https://understanddrupal.com/\">UnderstandDrupal.com</a> to a teaching platform with more resources in text and video format. Different people learn in different ways to it makes sense to offer both options. Additionally, a goald I really hope I can accomplish in 2021 is to translate the material to other languages. One of the primary goals of UnderstandDrupal.com is to make the content accessible to as many people as possible. As someone who is not a native English speaker, I know the language barrier can be very high. I started translating to Spanish and French myself. I couldn’t keep up with that, but I will try again this year.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>I love what you said about the scaling and cascading effect of an impactful training for the right attendees. Why did you get into teaching?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Going back to study groups in school, I liked that experience of learning together. It made us more efficient, made the process accountable. Now, in my day-to-day professional experience, teaching has made me a better developer, and has allowed me to learn a lot more about the subjects I teach. If I weren’t a developer, I would probably be a teacher.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, in 2019, I wrote a <a href=\"https://understanddrupal.com/31-days-of-migrations\">series of articles about Drupal migrations</a> for UnderstandDrupal.com which I&nbsp; consider the pinnacle of my Drupal contributions to date. It was 31 days straight trying to write a technical article every day. It seemed so reasonable at the beginning, but I was proven wrong early on. It could take up to eight hours to write an article. One of them took me 20 hours because I had to do a lot of&nbsp; research, debugging, and testing. So producing the series exaggerated all the benefits and all the difficulties in teaching and producing content.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I learned so much. Before I started writing that series, I had been doing migrations maybe for three years. I thought I knew enough to be brave and make that public commitment. By writing articles I think that my knowledge doubled or tripled in just that month, because I was so heads down into the topic., I would spend hours in the debugger stepping through the migrate API code, understanding, or trying to understand, how it worked.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I teach because I enjoy it, I like sharing my knowledge. When I started my journey, I didn\'t know of the Drupal community. For me, Drupal was a tool that allowed me to build a website without knowing a lot of HTML or CSS. It was probably six months later that I encountered my local community at a meetup. In five minutes, someone would answer what had taken me weeks, or months to investigate. So that’s why I teach, to be able to help others, save them time, and hopefully save them frustration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Where to find Mauricio</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupalnicaragua.org/\">Drupal Nicaragua community</a> can be found in many places, including <a href=\"https://groups.drupal.org/nicaragua\">groups.drupal.org</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/drupalni\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drupalni\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://understanddrupal.com/\">UnderstandDrupal.com</a> is Mauricio’s own site and project with pre-recorded courses on<a href=\"https://understanddrupal.com/migrations\"> Drupal Migrations</a> and <a href=\"https://understanddrupal.com/reactjs\">ReactJS</a>.

This is the second blog in the series, please read more about <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/why-an-easy-start-is-important-to-teaching-web-development/\">Mauricio Dinarte giving students a quick path to success here</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hilmar Hallbjörnsson has been a friendly face at Drupal events around the world for so many years we’re not sure where or when exactly we first met. Drupal GovCon? Drupal Europe? In a community fond of headwear, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/drupalviking\">Hilmar</a>, aka <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drupalviking\">drupalviking</a>, stands out in various horned helmets at events. He is currently living and teaching in Iceland and recently taught a web development course at <a href=\"https://en.ru.is/\">Reykjavík University</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How long have you been working with Drupal? </h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I\'ve been a Drupal developer for nine years now, starting back in 2011. Before that I had written three or four CMSs on my own. After I got to know Drupal, I started crying because I realized that I would never-ever-ever have to write authentication methods again. So it was love at first sight, definitely. In the nine years since it’s just kept growing and maturing in many ways.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Actually, admitting being a PHP developer in Iceland is difficult,&nbsp; it would be easier to admit that you belong to a goat sacrificing cult! People talk about how PHP was back in the day when we were running PHP 4.7 but all my servers are now on PHP 7.4, so things have changed just a bit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What topics do you teach new web development students?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I teach a course called \"Developing open sourced web software\" at Reykjavík University. Because of COVID, they called me in the middle of October, and asked me if I could deliver a course in the last week of November. My colleague, Reynir, and I looked at each other and said “Þetta reddast,” which is a common saying in Iceland: “We will figure it out somehow.” And we did! After this year, we might try to set that up so I could teach it in multiple schools as an online course.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The course begins with exploring: what is open software? What are the types of open software? What are the licenses? What does “free” and open source really mean? Then we got into how&nbsp; web software is delivered, with mostly open source AMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) stacks. Then we kept on going with how to contribute to open software.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We started with Drupal, had two projects, essays, a verbal exam, and students had to keep a diary to log what they did. Part of that was to train them to write good commit messages later and be able to verbalize what they were doing and why. They got to know Drupal as a site builder, creating a simple music or board game collection on the site, using views, user permissions, image styles and so on. We had to scale down the second project in the course from bug hunting to writing a little API that could look up a song or a board game, and then add it to a collection via services. That was a sufficient challenge for a three week course.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What tools, software, guides do you offer web development students?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For local development, I used <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev\">DDEV</a> exclusively. Connecting and setting up everything with DDEV — that was the second time I literally cried. I used to have problems down the ying-yang; I had written five or six huge blog posts just for my own reference on setting up my work computer, to get Apache running, MySQL running, trying to configure SSL (which never worked right), trying to get the debugger running. It was a headache and a half. Then maybe a year or two years later, when I had to do it all again, everything was outdated.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost the whole time that I\'ve been working I\'ve been a one man team. When you are in a bigger company you would have the DevOps expert who understands everything about Docker, and everything about what\'s happening under the hood. I was always trying to understand what exactly Docker was doing at the same time as I needed to be building the site, managing clients, and umpteen other task.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then I got DDEV, and being able to say `brew install ddev`, then just the `ddev config`, enter, enter, enter, then `ddev start`. My site is up and running! Oh, I need more memory for Maria DB? Okay, no problem, tikatikatak, `ddev restart`, up and running. So being able to both use it professionally and to start students on a project was great.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I did record a few lectures because we had a very short timeframe of three weeks so there wasn’t time to send them off to research on their own as much. I also refer students to Drupalize.me as supplementary material to the lectures.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But, again, having a tool like DDEV helped me out a lot. DDEV have done the hard work, you are the experts in Docker. I was able to explain how open source software works in general, then point them to DDEV and have them follow the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#quickstart-guides\">documentation to install Drupal</a>. It’s important to understand what\'s under the hood, but just as with a car, you know there is an engine in the front, and you know the shape of it. But probably you, like me, open the hood, and say nope! let\'s call a mechanic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What are some pros and cons to using DDEV for local web development?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a convert from Windows, I’ve been very happy with how quick and easy getting started with a local development environment on a Mac is. All my students that had Mac were up and running within 30 minutes. But we hit some snafus with Windows. Some of them were because they had some other web servers or <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/troubleshooting/#webserver-ports-are-already-occupied-by-another-webserver\">port problems</a>. Any previously configured machine from a student who installed a lot of programs for some of their courses was a headache, but we were able to get everybody up and running. My colleague Reynir runs Windows himself, so he took care of all the Windows people. On his personal machine it was smooth once we figured out that <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/ddev-wsl2-getting-started/\">WSL</a> was the way to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is a little bit of DDEV documentation that could improve. I was trying to use Drupal Console but I couldn’t find how to initiate the Drupal Console with the command line as you would with Drush, eg `ddev drush`. <em>ed note: There’s now an </em><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65400086/drupal-console-with-ddev\"><em>answer for this on StackOverflow</em></a><em>, and </em><a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/custom-commands/\"><em>any custom command can be added to DDEV</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also noticed if I was trying to debug with drush commands, <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-local/ddev-local-phpstorm-and-xdebug-debugging/\">xdebug, and phpstorm</a>, I had to <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli-usage/#ssh-into-containers\">ssh into the web container</a> and then run the commands, going into the vendor directory. It was just an unfamiliar sequence of things I had to do in order to get to the right place and run the right commands.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In general, the documentation is good, but it’s very technical. It would be nice to have more visual guides rather than just text. I experience that a lot in my hobby, board games, reading and editing a lot of rule books, so I know that a user often wants a more visual explanation. It’s easy to skip over a line of text and miss something very essential. For a lot of people who are a bit less used to technical documentation it can be a hurdle to get started.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/\">DDEV-Live hosting</a> would also benefit from a really clear guide: this is what you do to get up and running, and you’re done. <em>ed note: Once you sign up for an account on DDEV-Live there’s now a visual stepper to </em><a href=\"https://dash.ddev.com/get-started\"><em>get started</em></a><em>.

After that experience, I am more confident that I made the right decision back in 2011 with Drupal! I tried Joomla and Magento back in the day but they’ve changed so much since then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve also done some custom CMSs with very strange customer requests. Probably the most fun that I’ve had was to make a website where you rented sheep. You would rent a sheep for a year, it lived on the farm, and you got the lamb in spring, then the mutton, wool and whatever in the fall. You could go visit “your” sheep of course, and there was a social aspect on the site with photos and such. But a disconnect with the salesperson resulted in overpromising and under delivering and it didn’t work out. It actually would be very, very exciting to try to implement that again, and use Drupal to do that. It was that kind of project that is so absurd that you really want to see it through.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How did you become interested in teaching web development?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before I graduated back in 2012, I was a teacher\'s assistant. For my last year, I was the TA for people not living close to Reykjavík who had online meetings instead of in person, so virtual learning is not new to me. My professor was always saying we needed to teach more PHP, all these CMSs are based on it, and that idea just got more focused on Drupal over time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At Reykjavík University, we have a special project to culminate our studies where students work on something outside of the school, in the “real world,” instead of writing a thesis. I was working as a project manager for the Music Association of Iceland which had a very old system that needed new software, database migration, everything. I approached Reykjavík University with that project, and we were lucky enough to get a great great team of five people, four of whom were women. So, when the school project was finished we were about 85% ready to actually deploy, and that code has actually been up and running since. Very proud of that. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then this past fall I pitched a Drupal migration as a project for students and had three students the whole semester doing a Drupal 7 to Drupal 9 transformation of a site. So I was already teaching Drupal when they asked me, can you do this intensive course? Then we just gathered a bit more material and carried on. And now we are proud to say that two of the students are now employees of our company, <a href=\"https://umadgera.is/\">Um að gera</a>. Even prouder that we were able to hire women in both positions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone learns in different ways for sure. For me, I learn visually, and I learn by example — I am not the greatest investigator. A colleague and best friend of mine works very differently from me, but as a pair we work so great together. He gets bored very, very quickly so he is constantly trying out new things. That\'s not what I like to do. He can go and say, okay, I boiled it down, I checked seven different things this is how you do it. He explains that to me in maybe 30 minutes, 60 minutes, because we know each other’s lingo. Then I implement that, and I take it further. And that just works well together. So, strengthening people’s individual skills and tendencies and helping them find where they fit in a team is also an important part of teaching.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What do you see in the future for teaching, web development, and open source?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think we just have to do more. What I want to see is: can we streamline and standardise how we teach Drupal? As I said, everyone learns differently, but there are so many approaches, methods, materials it’s overwhelming. Drupalize.me is quite a good website, but the structure going from A to B to C is sometimes a little bit convoluted. I struggled a lot when I was doing the transition from how to site build into teaching people how to really program. Then I found this book — called <a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/product/drupal-9-module-development-third-edition/9781800204621\">Drupal Nine Module Development</a>, by Daniel Sipos, that was very helpful and very up to date.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the same time, I was transitioning from functional programming to object oriented programming. Teaching this course also revealed how hard it is to teach object oriented programming. It\'s much easier to explain object oriented programming when you have some concrete things to implement, like when I have my students implement custom entities. Just by explaining how the interfaces connect, and I am implementing this interface, and I am extending a base abstract class... The learning curve is such a steep one. You\'re not only teaching PHP, and Drupal, you\'re also teaching object oriented programming to people who haven’t encountered anything like it before.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How do you think we could unify efforts and standardize teaching Drupal? Is there an initiative for that already?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If there is an initiative, I would definitely want to be a part of that. We need to have a unified process so there are various tracks to get into Drupal. Where are your skills? Every skillset is important. When we started giving people <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/contribution-credit\">contribution credit</a> for documentation and contributing in other ways, not just code, that made our community much, much better. We were almost deteriorating the community by putting coders on a pedestal, and everybody else was not recognized. Having people who are specialists in QA, or who are great with writing or marketing is equally as important as writing the code itself.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We need an initiative to address how we are teaching Drupal to the world so that any person can come in and understand how things work and how they fit in. That’s why I’m very interested in doing this, to create a solid toolbox for teachers, and to share ideas on how to teach and how to build using realistic example projects. Something you can go through from installation to completion, from a variety of angles. If you’re a site builder start here, do this. If you’re a designer, download this, follow this guide. We are drowning in work in the Drupal world, we need all the help we can get, so how about we have a great way to teach newcomers?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Where to find Hilmar</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hilmar’s company, for which he is backend Drupal dev, DevOps expert, CEO and CTO is <a href=\"https://umadgera.is/\">Um að gera</a>, and his personal blog is <a href=\"https://drupalviking.com/\">DrupalViking.com</a>.

A workflow that supports both the tools you already use and the way you work with others can help ease some bottlenecks and communication mishaps. That’s what <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/#ddev-preview\">DDEV Preview</a> offers! In this blog, we’ll talk about how using a shareable preview site as one step in a software release process can support a <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/devops/what-is-devops/\">DevOps workflow</a> that incorporates safety for the humans and security for the code.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Make testing easier and ultimately ship better-quality work</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/what-is-ddev-preview/\">Preview sites</a> are created from a pull request (PR) in your GitHub repository, or a merge request (MR) in a GitLab repository. They are available via URL, interactive via CLI, and can be connected to other tools using an API token. It takes <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/preview-bot/\">one command</a> to create a pull request preview site, which can then be used to test whatever upgrades you’ve made, catch bugs, and finally deploy with confidence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Plus, with the user-friendly URL a preview site can be tested for accessibility, plugged into visual regression testing tools, run through QA or user acceptance testing (UAT). This flexible workflow empowers engineering teams to use whichever tools and methodology they prefer. Don’t wait until the last minute to make sure the work is right, test early and often!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Get stakeholder feedback faster and move on to your next feature</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once a new feature or bug fix is in place, you might want to confirm the change with a stakeholder from the business team, or even a client. Instead of waiting for an environment to be provisioned or setting up your local machine to be a web host, set an <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/sites/#setting-expiration-on-your-site\">expiration</a>, share a URL, and take the evening off.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By removing the bottlenecks in the review process such as waiting on server provisioning or the availability of one reviewer, work can move forward at a steady pace. Create a preview site and leave the link on your PR so your code reviewers can click through and see it live. That makes it even easier for reviewers who may not have their <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">local environment</a> set up for quick code pulls to see work-in-progress in action. No need to wait until the project is live online to make sure the work is right; stakeholders can participate and validate work throughout the process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Truly collaborate with team members around the world</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A functional, healthy, engaged team is key to getting basically anything done. How can we help various team members to work in harmony? By giving them tools to participate, enabling them to self-serve without bottlenecks, and creating a sense of safety to experiment and to fail.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a reviewer, I want to quickly view my colleague’s design work-in-progress in order to leave a review for them. As a QA expert, I need to be able to see new work in a production-like environment before we deploy. As a business stakeholder I need to see what to expect in the upcoming release without needing to understand how to brew code. As a project manager, I need to show the client the new feature they’re requesting before we deploy. And as a developer, I want to demo and stress-test the cool new feature I’ve been working on without breaking prod.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every one of those needs can be enabled by a preview site. A project owner, say the developer or the project manager, can create the preview site with a command and share that URL with others. Being able to conduct work simultaneously in different stages of the workflow means no one is waiting for each other or slowing the flow. The net result is faster development, increased margins and increased customer satisfaction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Save time and money by only paying for the resources you use</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Preview sites can also be thought of as on-demand staging environments. The idea is that they are temporary, not taking up resources any longer than is needed, but also available when you need them. That’s why <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/release-notes-platform-updates-plus-ddev-preview-faq/#FAQ\">a preview site is actually a clone</a> created based on a parent site, using the new code from a PR in combination with the assets and config from the parent. This reduces the time to create the preview and helps ensure that you’re working with a production-like environment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Preview sites can be used alongside your current tools and hosting providers — you don’t need to use DDEV for hosting your live site. Sites are manageable through the ddev-live command line tool and can be tagged, organized, and deleted. All you really need is a project in a repository on <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/providers/\">GitHub or GitLab</a> to connect to and start working from. Preview is something you can get up-and-running right now in just a few minutes and start using it, no matter your current development workflow</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re using DDEV-Live for your hosting needs already, then the Preview features are a nice value-add for your investment. Since it’s already part of your software development lifecycle (SDLC), the benefits are even greater because the infrastructure is already part of your workflow. The flexibility to spin up and automatically delete preview sites almost at will can be a big boon to your bank account when you’re running testing and qa on multiple projects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Transparent workflows support communication and agile development</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A lot of <a href=\"https://drupal.tv/external-video/2019-02-16/achieve-devops-nirvana-putting-one-foot-front-other\">DevOps philosophy</a> boils down to making workflows transparent. Transparent workflows are visible workflows, and visible workflows enable clear communication between all involved. Offering visibility into work-in-progress very literally with a preview site fits in nicely. The benefits to dev team members, business stakeholders, and clients include rapid iterations, continuous alignment, and more frequent successful deployments.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We don’t need to release a unicorn feature every quarter.

The <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/what-is-ddev-preview/\">Preview feature</a> in the DDEV platform allows team members to create a preview site by adding a single comment to a PR `/ddev-live-preview-site`.

Historically, many of us would access a live site using SSH for direct shell access on a single static server for traditional hosting. Some hosting providers give limited access to run single commands from a local command line, or start a remote shell session with more complicated commands, but there are delays and it can be a bit like fiddling around in the dark. Add some Kubernetes-based, containerized hosting into the mix and it can feel really intimidating and complicated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With the release of <a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/getting-started/#install-the-ddev-live-cli\">DDEV-Live CLI</a> version 0.9.2 and <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev-apis/releases/tag/v0.7.1\">API v 0.7.1</a> you now have the option of initiating an interactive session with a site on our <a href=\"https://ddev.com/ddev-live/\">Kubernetes-based hosting platform</a>. We handled the complicated parts so you don’t need to understand the container architecture that holds your project— just connect, navigate around inside the project, and use your command line tools as usual. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How do I run commands on a remote host?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Previously, in order to run command line tools on a project in a DDEV-Live environment such as production or <a href=\"https://www.ddev.com/ddev-live/#ddev-preview\">Preview</a>, you could run a single command using <code>ddev-live exec</code>. (For those of you familiar with the <a href=\"https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/cli-usage/#executing-commands-in-containers\">DDEV-Local <code>ddev exec</code> command</a>, this is similar behavior that allows you access inside the web container.) Each command was run individually, and it was difficult to observe the results of the command. Commands could take an unknown period of time to execute, resulting in a loss of momentum, productivity, and even causing a little frustration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These direct commands are still available and have plenty uses, for example if you just want to set configuration or trigger a single command such as:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><code>ddev-live exec mysite -- drush cr</code></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Until now, running these commands could take several minutes, and the DDEV-Live CLI gave minimal feedback. This is because any command sent using <code>ddev-live exec</code> created what’s called a “<a href=\"https://docs.ddev.com/jobs/\">job</a>” in the backend on our platform, which would enter a scheduling queue and eventually would be executed. Once the job was actually triggered, the command would run in the expected amount of time, so the delay was just in how the command passed from the user to the project. Good news! We’ve found a better way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Interactive exec for production containers</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, the <code>ddev-live exec</code> command consumes <a href=\"https://github.com/drud/ddev-apis\">our API</a>, which gives everyone more options and flexibility. The exec command itself is faster as a single command and it offers an exciting new interactive mode! Check it out: start a session with <code>ddev-live exec mysite --i [command]</code> and the CLI will start a bidirectional stream of command output between your terminal and the Kubernetes pod where your project lives. The flag <code>--i</code> runs the exec command as an interactive session.  Omit it to run a single command as non-interactive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead of waiting for a scheduled “job” to run somewhere in Kubernetes, commands execute right away in both interactive and non-interactive modes. Thanks to the API, you will not connect <em>directly</em> to the pod in Kubernetes, you connect to an API server which brokers everything you type to Kubernetes:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Client &lt;====&gt; API Server &lt;===&gt; Kubernetes</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“That was a bunch of words!” you say.
