# Reporting Security Issues

Magento values the contributions of the security research community, and we look forward to working with you to minimize risk to Magento merchants. 

## Where should I report security issues?

We strongly encourage you to report all security issues privately via our [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/magento).  Please provide us with relevant technical details and repro steps to expedite our investigation.  If you prefer not to use HackerOne, email us directly at `psirt@adobe.com` with details and repro steps.
