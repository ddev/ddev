# DDev Apache Solr recipe file.
#
# To use this in your own project:
# 1. Copy this file to your project's ".ddev" directory.
# 2. Create the folder path ".ddev/solr/conf".
# 3. Copy the Solr configuration files for the appropriate plugin/module to
#    ".ddev/solr/conf". For example, using Drupal 7's Search API Solr module,
#    copy the files from its "solr-conf/6.x" directory into ".ddev/solr/conf"
#    so that a file exists with the path ".ddev/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml".
#
# Notes:
# - The configuration files must be present before running "ddev start".
# - Changes to the configuration files will not be automatically applied.
#
# To access Solr after it is installed:
# - The Solr admin interface will be accessible at:
#   http://<projectname>.ddev.site:8983/solr/
#   For example, if the project is named "myproject" the hostname will be:
#   http://myproject.ddev.site:8983/solr/
# - To access the Solr container from the web container use:
#   http://solr:8983/solr/
# - A Solr core is automatically created with the name "dev", i.e. it can be
#   accessed at the URL: http://solr:8983/solr/dev
