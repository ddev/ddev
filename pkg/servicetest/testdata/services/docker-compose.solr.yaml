# DDev Apache Solr recipe file.
#
# To use this in your own project:
# 1. Copy this file to your project's ".ddev" directory.
# 2. Create the folder path ".ddev/solr/conf".
# 3. Copy the Solr configuration files for the appropriate plugin/module to
#    ".ddev/solr/conf". For example, using Drupal 7's Search API Solr module,
#    copy the files from its "solr-conf/6.x" directory into ".ddev/solr/conf"
#    so that a file exists with the path ".ddev/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml".
#
# Note: The configuration files must be present before running `ddev start`.
