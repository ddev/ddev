## Create an Issue

If you find a bug in this project, have trouble following the documentation or have a question about the project – create an issue! There’s nothing to it and whatever issue you’re having, you’re likely not the only one, so others will find your issue helpful, too. For more information on how issues work, check out github's [Issues guide](http://guides.github.com/features/issues).

### Issues Pro Tips

- **Check existing issues** for your issue. Duplicating an issue is slower for both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what you’re running into has been addressed already.
- **Be clear** about what your problem is: what was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem.
- **Link to demos** recreating the problem on things like JSFiddle or CodePen.
- **Include system details** like what the browser, library or operating system you’re using and its version.
- **Paste error output** or logs in your issue or in a Gist. If pasting them in the issue, wrap it in three backticks: ` ``` ` so that it renders nicely.
