## Create an Issue

If you find a bug in this project, have trouble following the documentation or have a question about the project – create an issue! There’s nothing to it and whatever issue you’re having, you’re likely not the only one, so others will find your issue helpful, too. For more information on how issues work, check out github's [Issues guide](http://guides.github.com/features/issues).

### Issues Pro Tips

- **Check existing issues** for your issue. Duplicating an issue is slower for both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what you’re running into has been addressed already.
- **Be clear** about what your problem is: what was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem.
- **Link to demos** recreating the problem on things like [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/).
- **Include system details** like what the browser, library or operating system you’re using and its version.
- **Paste error output** or logs in your issue or in a [Gist](http://gist.github.com/). If pasting them in the issue, wrap it in three backticks: ` ``` ` so that it renders nicely.

## Pull Request

If you’re able to patch the bug or add the feature yourself – fantastic, make a pull request with the code! Once you’ve submitted a pull request the maintainer(s) can compare your branch to the existing one and decide whether or not to incorporate (pull in) your changes.

### Pull Request Pro Tips

- **[Fork](http://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository** and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original ‘upstream’ repository by adding it as a remote. - Pull in changes from ‘upstream’ often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts - will be less likely. See more detailed instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).
- **Create a [branch](http://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)** for your edits.
- **Be clear** about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate that problem or why your feature will help. Then be  equally as clear about the steps you took to make your changes.
- **It’s best to test**. Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
- **Contribute in the style of the project** to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.
