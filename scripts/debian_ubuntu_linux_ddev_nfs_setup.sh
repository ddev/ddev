| Setup native NFS on Linux for Docker

| Please note that ddev NFS support on Linux is not a particular
| performance gain, since docker on Linux is already very fast.
| You may not need/want to use it.
| If you do use it, this script sets of very restrictive /etc/exports that
| you will probably need to modify to suit your needs, especially if you're
| using DHCP and your IP address changes periodically.
