# This PowerShell script tries to do almost all the things required to set up
# an Ubuntu WSL2 instance for use with DDEV and Docker Desktop.
# It requires that an Ubuntu wsl2 distro be installed already, preferably with `wsl --install`, but it can also be
# done manually.
# It requires that Docker Desktop is installed and running, and that it has integration enabled with the Ubuntu
# distro, which is the default behavior.
# You can download, inspect, and run this, or run it directly with
# Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;
