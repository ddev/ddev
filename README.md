# ddev

The purpose of *ddev* is to support developers with a local copy of a site for development purposes. It runs the site in Docker containers.

You can see all "ddev" usages using the help commands, like `ddev -h`, `ddev start -h`, etc.

## Key prerequisites
- A working [docker install](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
- The [ddev binary](https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases)

---

## Usage
```
➜  .drud ddev --help
This Command Line Interface (CLI) gives you the ability to interact with the ddev to create a local development environment.

Usage:
  ddev [command]

Available Commands:
  config      Create or modify a ddev application config in the current directory
  exec        Execute a Linux shell command in the webserver container.
  hostname    Manage your hostfile entries.
  import      Import an existing site to the local dev environment
  list        List applications that exist locally
  logs        Get the logs from your running services.
  restart     Restart the local development environment for a site.
  rm          Remove an application's local services.
  sequelpro   Easily connect local site to sequelpro
  ssh         SSH to an app container.
  start       Start the local development environment for a site.
  stop        Stop an application's local services.
  version     print ddev version and component versions

Use "ddev [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


## Getting Started
Check out the git repository for the site you want to work on. `cd` into the directory and run `ddev config` and follow the prompts.

```
$ cd ~/Projects
$ git clone git@github.com:drud/drupal8.git
$ cd drud-d8
$ ddev config
Creating a new ddev project config in the current directory (/Users/username/Projects/drupal8)
Once completed, your configuration will be written to /Users/username/Projects/drupal8/.ddev/config.yaml


Project name (drupal8):

The docroot is the directory from which your site is served. This is a relative path from your application root (/Users/username/Projects/drupal8)
You may leave this value blank if your site files are in the application root
Docroot Location: docroot
Found a drupal8 codebase at /Users/username/Projects/drupal8/docroot
```

Configuration files have now been created for your site. (Available for inspection/modification at .ddev/ddev.yaml).
Now that the configuration has been created, you can start your site with `ddev start` (still from within the project working directory):
```
$ ddev start

Starting environment for drupal8...
Creating local-drupal8-db
Creating local-drupal8-web
Waiting for the environment to become ready. This may take a couple of minutes...
Successfully started drupal8
Your application can be reached at: http://drupal8.ddev.local
```
And you can now visit your working site. Enjoy!

## Listing sites

To see a list of your current sites you can use `ddev list`.

```
➜  ddev list
1 local site found.
NAME   	TYPE   	URL                      	DATABASE URL   	STATUS
drupal8	drupal8	http://drupal8.ddev.local	127.0.0.1:32852	running
```

## Removing a site

You can remove a site by going to the working directory for the site and running `ddev rm`.

## Interacting with your Site
All of the commands can be performed by explicitly specifying the sitename or, to save time, you can execute commands from the site directory. All of the following examples assume you are in the working directory of your site.

### Retrieve Site Metadata
To view information about a specific site (such as URL, MySQL credentials, mailhog credentials), run `ddev describe` from within the working directory of the site. To view information for any site, use `ddev describe sitename`.

### Viewing Webserver Logs
To follow the webserver  error log (watch the lines in real time), run `ddev logs -f`. When you are done, press CTRL+C to exit from the log trail. If you only want to view the most recent events, omit the `-f` flag.

### Executing Commands
To run a command against your site use `ddev exec`. e.g. `ddev exec 'drush core-status'` would execute `drush core-status` against your site root. Commands ran in this way are executed in the webserver docroot. You are free to use any of [the tools included in the container](#tools-included-in-the-container).

### SSH Into The Container
To interact with the site more fully, `ddev ssh` will drop you into a bash shell for your container.

## Tools Included in the Container
- Composer
- Drush
- WP-CLI
- Mailhog

## Building

 ```
 make
 make linux
 make darwin
 make test
 make clean
 ```

## Testing
Normal test invocation is just `make test`. Run a single test with an invocation like `go test -v -run TestDevAddSites ./pkg/...`

If you set the environment variable DRUD_DEBUG=true you can see what ddev commands are being executed in the tests.
