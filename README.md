ddev is an open source tool that makes it simple to get local PHP development environments up and running in minutes. It's powerful and flexible as a result of its per-project environment configurations, which can be extended, version controlled, and shared. In short, ddev aims to allow development teams to use Docker in their workflow without the complexities of bespoke configuration.

## Getting Started

1. **Check System Requirements:** We support recent versions of macOS, Windows 10, and Linux distributions that will run Docker (ddev requires Docker and docker-compose). ([more info here](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#system-requirements)).
2. **Install ddev:** [Options include](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation) macOS homebrew (recommended), an install script, or manual installation.

Having trouble? See our [support options below](#support). You might have trouble if [another local development tool is already using port 80 or 443](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/troubleshooting/#unable-listen).

## Partial Feature List

* Quickly create multiple local web development environments based on code repositories.
* Import database for a project you're working on.
* Import upload files to match the project (e.g. Drupal's sites/default/files or WordPress's wp-content/uploads).
* Pantheon integration - grab a Pantheon archive and work locally with the database and files.
* Run commands within the docker environment using `ddev exec`.
* View logs from the web and db containers.
* Use `ddev ssh` to explore the linux environment inside the container.
* List running projects with `ddev list`.
* Snapshot databases with `ddev snapshot`.
* Temporarily share your development website with other using `ddev share`.
* Trusted HTTPS support

Just running `ddev` will show you all the commands.
