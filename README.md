# ddev

ddev is an open source tool that makes it dead simple to get local PHP development environments up and running within minutes. It's powerful and flexible as a result of its per-project environment configurations, which can be extended, version controlled, and shared. In short, ddev aims to allow development teams to use Docker in their workflow without the complexities of bespoke configuration.

## Roadmap

Each DRUD product has a dedicated product owner, who serves as the primary advocate for customers and end-users when making decisions regarding the public roadmap. For the [ddev roadmap](https://github.com/drud/ddev/wiki/roadmap), @rickmanelius is currently serving as the product owner.

We use the longer-term roadmap to prioritize short-term sprints. Please review the [ddev roadmap](https://github.com/drud/ddev/wiki/roadmap) and [ddev issue queue](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues) to see what's on the horizon.

## System Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) version 17.05 or greater
- OS Support
  - macOS Sierra
  - Linux
    * Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
    * Debian Jessie
    * Fedora 25
  - Windows 10 Pro

We are open to expanding this list to include additional OSs as well as improve our existing support for the ones listed above. Please [let us know](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/new) if you hit an issue!

### Using ddev with other development environments
ddev requires ports 80 and 3306 to be available for use on your system when sites are running. If you are using another local development environment alongside ddev, please ensure the other environment is turned off or otherwise not using ports 80 and 3306.

If you need to use another environment after using ddev, simply ensure all of your ddev sites are stopped or removed. ddev only uses system ports when at least one site is running.
