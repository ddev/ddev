this is the source definitions for the scary escape code regex

# from tests in Terminal.app, this regex should cover all basic \e[ and \e] cases
^([\[\]]([\d\?]+)?(;[\d\?]+)*)?.

# this catches any case the above does not
# make sure to not include any special characters the main regex finds (like ?)
\[[^a-zA-Z0-9@\?]+.

# esc + paren + any single char
[\(\)].

# didn't re-check this one (not included)
[\[K]\d+;\d+
