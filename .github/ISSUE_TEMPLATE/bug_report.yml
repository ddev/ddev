        Whether you‚Äôre having trouble or not, help us with context that will skip a bunch of questions we'd have to ask afterwards:

        1. Make sure you‚Äôre on the [latest stable version](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/latest) before reporting, [upgrading](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/) if necessary.
        2. Run a diagnostic and post the results as a new Gist (or your favorite equivalent). Run `ddev debug test`, or download and run [test_ddev.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddev/ddev/master/cmd/ddev/cmd/scripts/test_ddev.sh), and share a link to the results via https://gist.github.com. (If this works, there may not be something wrong with DDEV but something to [troubleshoot in your project](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/usage/troubleshooting/).)
