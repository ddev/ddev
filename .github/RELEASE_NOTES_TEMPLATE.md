# Installation/Upgrade

See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/drud/ddev/blob/master/docs/index.md) for details, but it's easy:

- macOS or Linux Homebrew: `brew upgrade ddev`
- Linux or macOS via script:
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drud/ddev/master/scripts/install_ddev.sh | bash`
- Windows: Download the ddev_windows_installer above or `choco upgrade ddev`

And anywhere, you can just download the tarball or zipball, un-tar or un-zip it, and place the executable in your path where it belongs.
